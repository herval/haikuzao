a skein of birds
twines across the sky
the northbound train departs

dawn chorus begins
I reach for
the snooze button

en haut des cuisses
dans l'espace sous le slip
un morceau de mer

new March snow
the grouse with a missing toe
still around

Remembrance Day-
even the traffic
pauses for 2 minutes

21-gun salute-
mortar fire echoes
in his eyes

dignified march-
veterans and peacekeepers
pass the applause

morning commute-
headlights fade
in the whiteout

homebound ferry
thoughts zigzagging
with the terns

yellow walnut leaves
slowly appear on the lawn--
early morning light

the mulberry--
one brief smell of cut wood
in two hours work

the tang of hot tar
carried on a breeze --
summer's end

summer clouds --
not enough paint to hide
the graffiti

rabbit and the hawk -
an awful truth stains
the fresh snow red

quick mid-winter thaw
each icicle drips
at its own pace

medicine wheels
cairns of field stone appear
in the cold spring fog

shoots of green grain-
old abandoned houses
stand along the highway

dirtballs, dust and clay
a drilling rig's relentless motion

through autumn's dusk
the computer wanes and hums
one hundred crows

autumn deepens
we gather the few
remaining seeds

an aroma
of green walnuts
summer dusk

100 degree heat
country-western music
from the asian bar
100 degrés (Fahrenheit)
la musique country
du bar asiatique 

reaching
for a new found warmth
sweet rhubarb cake 

she's found the gate
in the wall of willows
sunlight of spring

distant voices
a thin crust of ice
lingers on snow

solo trip
in the campfire smoke
old memories

long ago
I threw your letters away
footprints in snow

afraid of a boy
with an old man's eyes
needles of frost

the best lies
have the fewest details
cold half-moon

dull in a crescent's light
a canoe rests on the roof
autumn flood

a few leaves remain
at the ends of the branch
a brittle moon

sunflower
the day passing
slowly

August moon
countless raindrops to measure
the length of the day

moon phase
the welfare check
comes on the fifth

rose petals
fallen on bare earth
evening rain

raindrops
my sister's voice
from half a continent
away

morning fog
the bluebird's call
clearly audible

the wasp
trapped between panes of glass
first spring light

a hazy moon
floats in my cup
white sake

temperature rising
thunderstorms and traffic noise
through the north window

homeless
pushing a cart along
Commerce Avenue

a line of coal cars 
viewed from the railroad bridge 
returning chill

icicles melting
another drunk pisses
in my alley

taking a bite
from a bitter orange
january thaw

christmas night
the little corner store
last to close

evening thunder
a homeless man
comforts his dog

city sunrise
these old buildings
cast long shadows

night shift--
in the parking lot car lights
dim near morning

what day is this?
the metronome gathers dust
in the corner

4th of July
hotter than
a firecracker 

no work today
a carpenter ant wanders
aimlessly

garage sale
customers discuss
philosophy 

garage sale
'tales of power'
for half price

taiko drummers
listening to silence
between the beats

no moon, no stars,
just dull light from the city
summer haze

lost
on wildwood road
water lilies directionless

suddenly
the toads go quiet
rain begins

long dry grass
bristles underfoot
iced tea

rabbit trail
nothing but ears
above the snow

firecrackers
far off in the distance
pepper on my tongue

between the drone
of lawnmowers
a scent of rain

returning chill
dissonate melodies
from the ice cream truck

waiting for the moon
before departing
ducks on the roof

galette des rois
personne pour me couronner
même pour un soir 

Medaglia d'oro
sul retro del gioiello
il mio sudore

pleine lune
si lumineuse et ronde
l'horloge de la gare 

brusques giboulées -
pleurs et puis rires de l'ado
en quete d'emploi

muddy grave -
the rich scent of roses
so red

full moon -
the bride tells me
it was forced

lingering cold...
the last jar of maple syrup
on the cupboard shelf

fridge magnet -
snack after snack
wasting away

advanced Parkinsonism
she wipes his dribbling saliva
remembers his kisses

half-moon
first day of the sales
in Oxford Street

unwanted memories
more present than the past

gale force wind
dandelion seeds
in ocean depth

old barn --
the swallows' nests
long abandonned

Eid's sale
the Sikh shopkeeper
opens later than usual

si ronde la lune
cette fin de Juillet cesarienne
pour la patronne du Green Cafe

wild Foehn
another murder
goes unsolved

mango flavoured tea
in a silver tin - departing guests
linger a while

a dry new year
december snowman begins
to show his age

alphabet soup -
my best haiku ever
...... digested

oh moon, moon
above so much powdery snow
father is still ill

a McDo box
floats towards the fountain
insect on board

lune des neiges
si froide encore
notre entente

first snow
the asylum seeker
thoughts on the land

lune des pluies
même plus long le jour
si sombre encore

checking dividends
on the cashpoint screen
to and fro...an ant

longue péniche
lente sur le canal
la lune

almost lost
among the shifting hues
of dusk
the faint calligraphy
of swans

crocus breeze -
my dying mother's words
come back to me 

august wind
on the dock seagulls
stand on two legs

sudden downpour -
the memory of a butterfly
washed away

the corridor
was long and dark...
news of your death
closer
with each step

from one year
to another -
the same moon

day moon -
the distance between us
full of silence

A rippled moon :
In the pond, 
A sinking stone.

Lighting the room,
candle by candle;
a winter evening.

my umbrella
flipped in the wind–
uncertain days

masons at work
creeping along the stone wall
afternoon fog

death of a friend
more leaves
turning brown

white sheets on the line
slow-motion clouds
in the summer sky

georgia peach
sweet cream and wrinkle remover
in the shopping cart

wild roses
the iron trellis
tilts to one side

spring dawn
with the returning geese
my mind takes flight

clothes dried on the line-
a spring morning
still in the folds

the old town
even now the rough stones
soak up the warmth

early morning walk
reaching through the mist
for wild berries

a walk to the beach
the asphalt road changes
to sand

morning mist-
we follow the scent
of slow moving cows

bird song
pulling me out of a dream
first day of spring

haiku group
the discussion stops
for a robin

bus stop-
the winter dance
of cold feet

une fesse après l'autre
elle me précède
gare Saint-Lazare

sea breeze --
under full sail
a pregnant skipper

fresh snow
beginning the new year
with a clean slate

party over
the snap crackle of logs
in an empty room

tea in china cups
the wet afternoon perfumed
with tangerine peels

the heat wave broken
morning coffee sweetened
with a cool breeze

cold sunshine
the stray orange cat
tucked into itself

sleety rain
flowered umbrellas
sold out

summer reading
the dot of an i
moves down the page

drifting
from somewhere
pear blossoms

a curve in the road
looking for lilacs
in the wind

the rain over
even with eyes shut
I know it's spring

road closed
moose tracks continue on
local traffic only

gray and cold-
a hothouse bouquet
for his widow

incoming fog
a forgotten memory
comes in flashes

from an open barn
the odor of hay and manure
and climbing roses

plot, plop on the road?
cars follow the cow trail
to the milking barn

moon gazing
fogging up the cold window
with my breath

snowy afternoon
a slow accumulation
of desire

stacking stones
for a garden wall
the weight of their age

bouquets of lilacs
the last bunch fills
a milk bottle

twilight rain
the scent of lilacs
through the window

dead heading lilacs
the fragrance lingers
in memory

strong winter wind
bits of Batman kite wings
fall from the tree

April warmth-
a new crop of dandelions
since yesterday

an ant in my bed-
for the two of us
not enough room

Hurricane Irene
in the semi-darkness
a cold breakfast

heavy time
slowly ticking the minutes
Hurricane Irene

Fourth of July
watching fireflies
on the lawn

between morning chores
I open the door-
lilacs in the rain

the neighbor's lilacs-
gathering the fragrance
to myself

all day long
the rhythmic beat
of melting ice

blank date book-
the gray afternoon
turns to white

sleet and rain-
stirring extra sugar
into hot mush

in the orchard
rotten apples now crunchy
winter solstice

tree trimming
we listen to the music
of soft rain

early autumn
the sound of falling water
is cold

at the lawn concert
lighting one spot at a time-
fireflies

cricket in the house-
if only we shared
the same bedtime

the Thanksgiving meal -
after eating the talk
slows down

black-out--
the holiday glow
of fireflies

black-out--
in my neighbor's house
a room to room glow

in the back alley
school-kids puffing away
in the shadow of a chimney

riverside promenade --
seniors stroll through
falling leaves

a koi rises
to meet a falling leaf -
autumn afternoon

strong wind
back and forth on lake ice
streetlight reflections

Empty eyes
gaze at a poppy field...
journey's end.

a layer of ice
forms on the red sleigh--
february rains

high tide--
feeling the moon's pull
in the waves

january freeze--
koi chase each other
above the television

groundhog day...
sharing a sausage
with friends

autumn seabreeze...
a film of salt forms
on his glasses

grey morning...
a whale on the beach lies
shrouded in fog

beyond blossoms
under the cherry tree...
white snow cover

new widescreen tv:
watching junk in
high definition

winter day's end... 
a bowl of brown rice miso, 
warm in the hands

homework --
after the school bus passes
a spider rebuilds

december warm spell
the neighborhood snowmen
are all plastic

frosty meadow-- 
another dawn
reaches across

between sips... 
reading a book 
about sake

her piano-playing 
comes to an end... 
sounds of autumn hail

first snowfall
the dog's legs
have become shorter

first snowfall...
here is a christmas card
to be mailed, last year

at a desk,
i write
this ku

a bluejay takes flight--
the neighbour's car
needs washing

grey sky
a monarch butterfly
lost in autumn

after the guests leave
the lilies
open

sultry afternoon
only the mailbox shadow
crosses the dirt road

old pond
after the frog
the stillness

frost
on the spent firework casing
new year's day

winter park -
white wings and blue lights
flashing

photo archive
the ice skaters' grins
frozen in time

a wasp
struggling in the web
last apples

clematis climbing
climbing through
the climbing rose

fifteen elephants -
after the storm
the cockerels waking 

anti social behaviour -
all night the wind
kicks a can around

day long weeding
the last dandelion
under my bench 

lazy rain
the solitary blackbird's
dawn chorus

black hole
near beaver dam a whirlpool spins
autumn leaves vanish

last light
on the allotment
the glow of a fag dimp

crushed shell
in the morning light
the snail's last movements

elevator
an ex's scent
hanging

returning from night shift
my neighbour
and his cat

the old barn wall
with every missing brick
a swallows nest

frosty morning
the steam rising from roofs
and my African coffee

recycled
with each bottle
the same resolution

morning mizzle
the screech of a gull
far from the sea 

tinted windows -
through the gap
his fingers wriggle thanks

approaching storm
even the gate
has lost its squeak 

long journey back home --
a forgotten bale of hay
slowly rots away

April 2nd
the snow
still lying 

two dog walkers
meet -
two conversations

the broken panes
of the old greenhouse -
still the new shoots

school fair
on the fireman's helmet
a faint smell of smoke

frozen dawn
the runner recovering
in his own steam 

morning rush hour
at the side of the road
wild damsons

Caruso recording -
the gramophone crackle
lights the fires in his eye

the police car slows -
suburban foxes
looting from bins

restless -
across the summer night
siren upon siren

still the spent firework's
cordite smell -
nest of serpents

balmy evening
the stillness of sheets
on the line
soir embaumé

the name
I didn't want to see -
bitter coffee

airborne again -
the roadkill's
feathers 

road trip
at the end of the argument
a patch of blue

the heather still in bloom -
we take Mum the long way
back to the hospice

chuntering at something
the blackbird on the fence post
- election day

weaving its way
through the rush hour traffic
a white butterfly

bringing only
silence
the storm cloud's weight

roadside memorial -
the faded plastic windmills
still racing

two minutes silence
the shifting light
of a windy day

hunter's moon --
the end of the path
darker

 

strong April wind
the smell of Iowa hogs
in Minnesota

earthquake night
Tokyoites walking home
the long Friday

back to my hometown
blooming with a sweet scent
mom's oriental lilies

jizo bon
akora mo sodachi
furu chochin

thunder rolling
thinking of my daughter
at the campsite

frozen blueberries
in a bowl of yogurt
by the fireside

hi wo abete
tsuyu konu uchini
akaki yuri

traffic jam
melting snow runs
on the windshield

a sunny day
pink haze of the cherry blossoms
over the hill

amefuri no
  minoru kaki yori
     hito shizuku

the old temple
a snake on the stone step
crawling away

afternoon escape
within the prison walls
a library

new year bon fire

typhoon warning
a farmer on the path
between the rice fields

March wind
a strawberry off
from my birthday cake

the farmer lady
a few daffodils in a basket
of white radish

a new year's bonfire
misty rain
on the embers

scent of lilies
orange pollen
on my white sweater

crisp morning air
a bird left his feather
at my window

muggy night
a lizard on the window screen
- motionless

summer night breeze
each wish
on bamboo branches

rain clouds
fragrance of
sweet basil

Christmas dinner
grandma's fruit cake attracts
only blue jays

cracking walnut--
there might be
another universe

around where the
steppingstone ends off
autumn gone

from an old temple
to an old temple
autumn wind

hundreds of
gentians blooming--
class reunion

typhoon passed--
one watering can
in the sandbox

typhoon passed--
comes the
local circus

red dragonflies
gather around the
blind person

after the storm
the wind chimes
realigning

riding down the escalator
the scent of snow
on damp coats

Day of the Oscars-
in the Spring sun
I plant onions...

spring evening
under a black umbrella
phone number and key

November clouds-
hearing of
my sister's illness...

april noon
out come the sun
and some slugs

street garden
again without leaves
faded graffiti

school bus
finally round the bend
lighting a cigarette

rubber boots
looking for the next
deeper puddle

rain clouds
basking in the light
of an Ikea lamp

persiana entreaberta
como desce lentamente
o sol nascente

manhã fria
nuvens vindas de longe
e das nossas bocas

água de limão
memórias de ser mais pequeno
e os verões maiores

zen garden
rain disappears
into pebbles

Afternoon rain;
Scents rise
From the garden.

rivulets
on a foggy window
the cancer's spread

first Christmas
a tiny new stocking
joins the family

moonlight
baby's cheek
at breast

early spring
everything
dripping

quitting time
the smell of rain
in the lobby

waves
slowly cresting towards shore
a faint moon

rainy bridge-
the river flowing
faster

spring breeze-
the balcony's shadows
on my book

winter drizzle
all the passing faces look
into the cafe

dwindling bonfire
a shooting star
near Orion

A spring morning;
The pond's surface blurred
By raindrops.

cold night-
a plane blinks through
Orion's bow

late night at the office
an exit sign floats
next to the moon

dark tree silhouettes
low on the horizon
Orion rises

Distant thunder--
the smell of rain
before the storm.

Under the Magnolia
red seeds float away--
November rain.

the boat crests a wave -
tracing my finger around
an ancient stone

urban geese -
voices extemporise
around a sitar

so cold -
a goose honks its way
across the night sky

sodium light -
a darker world beneath
the puddles

lockerbie -
the long walk from graveyard
into town

first date
not even noticing
the new moon

silbury hill -
my wife pregnant with our
first child

cold snap -
more than my prints
on the camera

summer haze-
a lone grey wolf pads south
along the highway

thrill of her flute -
twenty three years
of our lips touching

stilled by the stream -
delicate frost flowers
crunch under work boots

evening traffic -
caught in a low moon
the heron's flight

white sun ::
an inch of snow
on the lawnmower

harvest moon :
the bigger pumpkin
waits for a face

mill row ::
every door
a different color

harsh snow ::
a corpse
at the dam

coffee cold
she clips the obituary
from many papers

election day ::
a butterfly about to settle
on the seesaw

new moon ::
my sister's voice
after all this time

steam billows
from the cooling tower ::
sunrise

morning mist--
a canada goose
asleep on the dock

painting
the dark side of the house--
solstice

midnight--
the changing wind
in the silver maples

silent phone
only the ring
from his teacup

her fresh flowers -
his fresh grave
valentine's day

valentines -
the mailman's steps
break the ice

rush hour ~
closing the car window
on my hair

ancient stone circle
the flow
of a robin's song

rainy Baltimore
umbrella blossoms
in cafe windows

summer solstice
he remembers
to lift the sea

fresh paint
a white moth circles
the bug light

first snow fall - 
covered with maple leaves
at sunrise

first light
broken blue shell
under the maple

All Saints Day -
in the field only small
pumpkins are left

December dusk -
a solitary pine tree
all lit up

We talk in the street,
surrounded by melting snow
and mad rushing crowd

a vagabond on the bench
covered with a nude girl
on the newspaper

just before dawn
the bright moon
of the computer screen

her skin
pale in the moonlight
ebb tide

autumn chill -
the silence
of the bee hive

cloudy skies -
different shades of shadow
in the cauliflower

tai chi
slicing the morning mist
in quarters

the therapist says nothing
I haven't told myself -
rainless clouds

late night at the airport
the shoe shine man
polishes his own shoes

Buenos Aires tango
at the end of an alley
the Big Dipper

hot summer day
a bowl of picked berries
without sugar

beach house -
unlocking the gate
to the ocean

in and out
of the haiku lesson -
the fragrance of the lilies

open window
the moon's reflection
in the toilet bowl

Seafood tank,
Lobsters move slowly,
Far from Maine.

behind net curtains
her face glides from window
to window

jogging at dusk
around the neighborhood
the smell of garlic

Dead robin -- 
its breast still
burning red.

Not so good
for all the fish
Good Friday

St. Patrick's Day
in front of the pub
yellow pouring out of the daffodils

At rest
in the crow's nest
crescent moon

In Morse code
the woodpecker
announces spring

On the Ferris wheel
reaching up
to stroke the moon 

to the headstone
old footsteps frozen
in old snow

Japanese New Year
how small the new moon
in its halo

covered by snow
like the other stones
little Buddha

Awake 
Smell of rain 
two new haiga

matin noir
et blanc de brouillard
et ces croix de bois 

sugar for the tea
behind the bowl
a line of ants

fire ant mound
against the flower pot
after the rain

bonfire smoke
we talk about
our disappointments

new bookshelves
the poetry my cat finds
in an empty box

croissant crumbs
I try and find
the right words

summer rainstorm
the balloon man
sells umbrellas

sunset
the fisherman's silhouette
edged with light

three sneezes
all that's left
of the snowman

the cat shifts
from sunspot to sunspot
Sunday morning

sound of the rain -
penetrating my sleep
at dawn

making soup
my hands could be
my mother's hands

awake too early
trees shrouded in mist
the slow tick of a clock

the damp stain on the wall
only looks like a damp stain -
Monday morning

sunset over the sea
I remember when my mother
ran faster than me

again this year
the wind-sown poppies
flower between stones

thanksgiving
my mind wanders
to my dead brother 

crescent moon
just enough light
for this path

warm rain on the pond
my thoughts rise
with the koi

the red maple-
striptease
in the driveway

sunny afternoon
  an old man lingers
near the mailbox

police watch the crowds
at children's carnival
the horse's teeth

mountain stream
   two well placed rocks
the path home

winter clouds
seem to move slower too
in the cold night

it happened
just after the full moon
snow

in the dry grass
frost appears
on the fallen pears

autumn breakfast
the last mosquito's hover
over my campfire

evening flares
at summer's end
fireflies

summer's end-
a cool rain slides
down the hollyhocks

summer's end
my hand lingers
in the dry grass

dandelion seeds
  ai r  b  o   r   n
     in a cool breeze

Shivering
in the cold spring air.
  Plum blossoms!

door slam
the rumble of thunder
louder

along the road
shape of a willow
conforms to the trucks

obituary
a child's face
smiles from the page

puddle
from last nights rain
reflects the clouds

Fog on the mountain,
Rain tapping the window pane,
Cup of tea, steaming.

hospital room
the empty chair   takes
all the sunshine

slipping in
beneath the kitchen door
-first sunlight

paper moon-
falling off almost
this argument of mine

winter rain-
colder than ever
this bowl of rice

afternoon tryst ...
thunder bangs overhead
in the sticky heat

closet renovation--
removing all her clothes
she nails the carpenter

hurricane warning
the wildflowers
without butterflies

steamy sex
in the church parking lot -
amazing Grace 

the pastor's daughter
her Sunday dress
the color of bruises

carousel music ?
i still see my brother
on the painted pony

husband at work ?
the mailman knocks
to see the newborn

house renovation -
the magic mushrooms
he hid 25 years ago

hail storm
rearranging gravel
in the Zen garden

winter rain --
a flowered umbrella
at the funeral

late night date
sand in her bra
all day long

Sunday brunch
his eyes on the crumb
kissing her cleavage 

morning overcast--
she adds more blush 
to her cheeks

 drowned
in the sound of the rain
other familiar sounds

sudden hail--
we sip bitter coffee
rehashing last night

tasting
the freckle on her cleavage
with my eyes

rummage sale --
her husband in the chair
not worth keeping

garage sale --
the flowered couch on which 
I became a woman

arguing downstairs --
she shuts the windows
in her doll house

meditating and 
resplendent in sunlight--
she finally swats the fly

first snow . . .
next to the new calendar
a clean slate

train whistle . . .
palm prints linger
against the glass

wedding anniversary--
my parent's ashes, together
in the moonlight

surprise sneeze
the dandelion blows away
without a wish

freezing drizzle…
page after page 
its insistent drumming 

seasons stilled --
a red paper poppy
in memoriam

an ancient path
in a sky without time
departing geese

her Sunday dress
the color of bruises
merging

Saturday night
the sound of weeping
seeps from the wall

before dinner...
the spider and a fly
share the sunset

he kissed me
on the fourth of july
fireworks!

crossroads
the brown core
of an apple

lifting fog
the face of an old friend
on my morning walk

daybreak ...
still sipping bitter coffee
we rehash last night

stars at dusk
a spray of willow buds
by the gate

the moon
not quite full
but full enough

requiem mass -
flecks of dust drift
in stifling air

tense meeting --
my chewing gum
out of flavor

inhaling spring -
her new breast
two months old

morning rush
he finds a half red kiss
on his coffee cup

never in darkness
ground zero lights the night
New Year's Eve

moonless night -
the bell buoy
talks to itself

morning tea
he cups his hands
around the glass

winter solstice
candle too short
for lingering night

dying afternoon light
the doctor touches her
uncombed hair

snail mail
delivered
in the cold rain

Wedding Day -
in the bride's eyes
the groom's smile

mother and daughter
chess game --
two queens

haiku conference --
lecturer delivers address
in three short sentences

haiku moment --
she writes her number
on his napkin

against the glass -
her palm prints
linger

nude beach
about size
and sighs

on her nape
beads of rain
slowly I follow them down

kitchen encounter ~
tasting the wine
from his lips

summer sidewalk -
drops of rain
steam

water bed
dreams
undulating

thunder
slate sky
crocus peeking

making love
passionately all night 
the sounds of traffic

imagine
a field of dandelion fluffs
before the wind 

elle attend en haut
de l'escalier du métro
- la lune 

personne ne voit
les kakis rouges du
jardin abandonné

hurry up
to cross the trail
reckless snail !

sortant du sex-shop
feuilles rousses de printemps 

dimanche 7/1/7
le couteau à cheval
sur la fève

à la porte de chez Fauchon
une flaque de vomi
- fin de l'an

au macro-sillon
de la médiathécaire
mon regard plonge

dans un cageot
' Carottes de France '
des livres à un euro

Elle fit de la danse.
Ses gros mollets cuivrés
sous la pluie de septembre.

tête de station -
le taxi sikh ?
au turban blanc

dans l'appartement vide
la grande balafre du
soleil au sol

le recueil d'un ami :
un moine zen ratisse
l'angle de la couverture

ceinture brune : sa peau
entre top et pantalon

ce soir un grand match de football
les seins de cette femme enceinte

sous l'abri-bus
les vieilles tepu de l'avenue

deux dames d'un certain âge
parlent soutien-gorge

sun's rise
the voices of crows
lift it higher

son cul rond
montant l'escalier mécanique
demi-lune

frangé de blanc le lac
premier février
vers Metz

prise dans la Moselle
une bouteille
le cul en l'air

dans les phares du camion
les jambes de la femme
qui va rentrer dans l'immeuble

noir à fleurs bleues
le slip de l'altiste

de fesses en fesses
montant l'escalier

Fin novembre -
arrosant les rares soucis
encore en fleurs

le slip rouge

seule sa chaussure
gauche crisse --
sortie de la messe

Les bas quadrillés
sur les belles cuisses de cette femme

sun's rise
the voices of crows
lift it higher

dès que le soleil
éclaire la vitre du bus,
ce moustique s'excite

à peine demi
la lune droite
ciel clair de novembre

sur le trottoir
les feuilles s'agitent
bientôt la pleine lune

passant dans la rue Caroline
avec mes quatre artichauts
- goutte au nez

dormant
à côté du poisson orange -
pleine lune de novembre

la lisière de son slip
sur ses belles petites fesses
à quai

un livre en tente
sur sa poitrine
- vents et vagues

au coin de l'avenue
chaque matin vers 9 h 30
il ferme sa tente

petit concert de voitures
le matin
pour se mettre en route

le faîte de l'arbre
chatouille le nez

Canada Day
this country and I
aging together

pelle et balai
les cœurs en papier
parvis de la mairie

l'ombre
de son piercing au menton
marque midi

les yeux bleus
elle boit de l'eau de source -
veille de l'été

deux heures du matin
un tout petit insecte
traverse la page neuf

Des éclats de rires
tombent par la fenêtre
- samedi soir

la danse du tissu
autour des jambes de la femme
grève des transports

rumeurs du matin -
l'ombre d'une fumée
sur la façade blanche

Grande Marée
Le pétrole

Au pied du lampadaire
un sapin de janvier

Full moon night -
the shape of the mannequins' breasts
in the shop-window

ocean playground
the way memories come and go
with the tide

jusqu'à tard dans la nuit
nos deux tasses vides
depuis longtemps

milieu d'août
les haïkus
à marée basse

la poétesse
partie, restent les haïkus
et la tasse froide

les seins des mannequins
pointent dans la vitrine

New-York September

blackout --
how bright Mars shines
this summer night!

endless winter
more soft snow as we await
a new grandchild

skyscraper
a window-washer squeegees
the thunderhead

insomnia
the mouse)
has it too

afternoon rain-
a neighbor opening her curtains
too

a famished mallard
has emigrated
to the city zoo

bark beetles
in the Ponderosa pine
these gnawing doubts

rush hour -
one leaf's journey
to the ground

autumn trail
the smell of something wild
lingers

forest silence. . .
the cool green glow of lichen
wet with sunlit steam

old village. . .
mosquitos enough
for everyone

sweeping leaves. . .
her lovesong interupted
by a sigh

seed catalogues
in the mail daily--
morning snow fluries

under snow
the same earth
waiting waiting

dusk breeze
another birthday spent
viewing others

bamboo flute
mournful notes flying
to an absent moon

still smiling
water beads and drips
off Buddha's nose

suzukaze ya
ubune no nobori
mijikayoru

seed catalog
the colours of
a winter daydream

constellations
of quiet raindrops
sleepless night

cabin walls 
feeling my way through
a wilderness night

against my skin
the roughness of firewood
hoar frost

twilight
a cricket's 
sudden silence

just west of dawn
an earful of geese
heading south

tulips buried - 
the soft silence
of April snow

the grey sound
of a boat's emptiness
cold dawn rain

on the morning side
of the river's end
rising star

puddles of sky
a child's first step
in the clouds

moving day
my shadow by the pond
one last time

growth rings
a child sings her way
around a tree

my missing pen
the cat pretends sleep
on a winter's eve

unknowns
waiting for the wind
to cry again

sunday eve
the blues moan softly
across the pond

storm clouds
billowing in the wind
a stranger's coat

deep canyon
the grand voice
of a tiny wren

from Hiroshima
to Sendai . . .
so much just gone

desert night
a constellation of tents
glows yellow

smoke on the wind
midnight's every breath
tastes of fire

grey autumn day
knowing when it's time
in my bones

where trees bloom
with egrets at dusk
the quiet sky

at the deep end
of a winter day
birdsong

just extinguished-
smoke slowly curls
out pumpkin eyes

autumn equinox
opinions
turning

waiting by the door
the sun
rising
attendre à la porte
le soleil
levant 

shortest day--
her countdown to christmas
quickens

between train tracks
recumbent beer bottles
beset by frost

snowstorm
too many flakes
for haiku

the line of poplars
blackens a mackerel sky...
February blues

following me
downriver to work:
the pastel moon 

sharp night
a thin plume of smoke
from the fire station

crow after crow
the morning darkens
with biblical rain

honking through the darkness
long before their shapes:
the twilight geese

winter solstice
the street sweeper picks up
a glass half full

at either end
of the twelve-carriage platform:
spring mist

street of cafes:
cherry blossom gusts
across the tables 

hail on the train-
a young woman's leg
straddles her boyfriend's

almost spring
outside the embassy
plaque polishing

lengthening days
I turn the Christmas lights
off

for seconds between
flood rains: the sunny colours
of market mangoes

like scattering tacks:
the forecast record rainfall
on the bus's roof 

yellow moon
a glimpse of a porpoise
easing upstream 

the river streaks pell-mell
on either side of Eel Pie Island
two pied wagtails 

at Hampton Court
the river rises
to medieval levels...
the slow-motion beats
of a swan into flight

the forecast rain...
a queue-jumper gets berated
by everyone

late again-
the lights change
in the evening puddle

shortest day
three geezers paint
the pub's front green

steam train...
just over the wall
a winter-flowering cherry

through steamed-up windows the park fill of mist

perseid shower
the intake of her breath...
another contraction

nuit américaine
... les techniciens
se bousculent

din el ru
au p'tit matin
ène boît de conserv

Pluie fine
- sur le sol
écrasé,
un ver de terre.

Bruxelles-Munich -
course de mouches
sur l'écran du PC

au pied de la banque -
des pissenlits
en fleurs

débat télévisé -
ses seins affalés
dans le corsage 

Contre-jour -
au loin un grand chien
en liberté 

Coquilles d'escargots
vides -
premières pousses

An neuf -
la même rue ce matin
le silence en plus

perruque blonde - un petit sourire d'après chimio

my grandfather's sword...
the impenetrable silence
of falling snow

l'arbre mort
dans la forêt luxuriante -
couvert d'ex-voto

entracte -
on parle de la guerre
en coulisses

automne ce matin -
l'oiseau sur son épaule gauche

Jour de pluie
Au travers des vitraux
Le jasmin jaune

arthrite -
un autre verre de vin
de la main gauche

remue-ménage
dans le ventre de l'ordinateur -
j'ai faim

poussière grise
sur la cheminée de marbre -
et ta photo

le malentendant
avec ses lunettes -
noires

Après la dispute -
les assiettes sont encore
sales

Petit soleil -
au travers des vitres
sales

dull afternoon...
even the fresh snow
is tinted grey

sudden hail--
the argument breaks off
mid-sentence

sudden hail--
she tells me to be careful
what I wish for

distant thunder--
I dream I've forgotten
where my parents live

first frost--
the squirrel plants acorns
where we buried the cat

fall equinox--
a black squirrel running
on the power line

mudslide
the last rain of 2005
segues into '06

Hiroshima Day
a 13 kiloton
sunset

autumn leaves--
the harvest moon
fades

soleil d'hiver
le plat de ma main
sur la vitre froide

late winter snow
a distant train whistle
cuts through my silence

vue sur l'amère
quand elle se penche à la fenêtre
avec cet air vague

les mots sous les doigts
l'aveugle et son livre en braille
frottement du papier

watching
the lunar eclipse
a dead rose

pilgrim counts
every second step
stone in shoe

trinitarian glasses
help both speaker and listeners
to see more clearly

migrants à la une – 
l’hôte dans mon jardin
un oiseau sans nom 

à l'hôpital -
au fond du sac le sable

Canada Day we play another concert in the rain 
jour du Canada
nous jouons un autre concert

pluie d'hiver -

fin du voyage


heavy snowfall
a hawk on a fence post
almost white

winter depression the colour of rain in the river

waiting for you~
the changeful rhythm 
of the rain

airport gate ~
the undetected poison
of your words

spring changes...
I clean rust off the latch
of an old desire

mountain rain -
the beetle and i
scurry for cover

raindrops plop
into my coffee cup
summer rain 

spring in the air -
the stone path to the mailbox
well polished

autumn light - 
in the silent glades
me and the gun...

late fall -
the scent of rain
in your hair

parting . . .
the clatter of train tracks
into dark

fading bougainvillea
 in the night sky . . .
    mars!

splatting drops . . .
  moments ago they held
      a rainbow

after the long wait . . .
  two unattended dove eggs
      in summer rain

from the armoire,
scent of passion in a candle
yet to be burned

mid October
the sudden thinness
of my robe

wood flute music
through an open window
the crow's rasp

cold May moon... the long road stretches out of sight

mothers' day
I let the phone ring longer
for her

scenting two pages
of the Webster's Unabridged . . .
wild lilac

Valentine's dinner--
nothing on the menu
suits him

stroke of  . . .
his snoring punctuated
by fireworks

stillness . . .
a few flat stones
beneath the pine

purple irises
stand still
rain or shine

lunch at the cove
the ebb and flow
of their conversation

distant thoughts-
the last ember
cools

more wine?
he places an afghan
around my shoulders

computer drone
overtaken by the sound
of pounding rain

cold May moon...
the long road stretches
out of sight 

deeper into autumn--
she aches for an honest touch

heat storm--
a quick breath between flash
and crashing thunder

in the mirror
a much older woman
returns my glance

April shower -
last drop
of green tea

Morning fog -
only the scent of
eucalyptus

rain all day stacks of old magazines closer to the door

church ruins
the grace
of a butterfly

pleasantly drunk
in the orchard
a flock of waxwings

Memorial Day
a layer of dust
covers his urn

hawk's hover -
the view of calm seas
through a gunport

overcast night
maybe the stars burn brightly
over Gaza

at the memorial
a hawk's cry
scatters her ashes

forty-six years
writing my name
yellow in snow

lueur du réveil
à la fenêtre
la pleine lune 

terrasse ensoleillée
oublier Noël
qui approche 

sur le tarmac gris
sous la pluie du retour
le bus jaune 

ne pas faire son lit
le défaire
jour de retour 

regardant les mouettes
fouiller les restes du marché
imaginer la mer 

à l'autre bout du monde
sur la vitre du train
la course des gouttes de pluie 

sous la pluie sans fin
sur la place grise
les couleurs du manège 

avec mon père 
parler d'apprendre à vieillir 
- l'odeur des clématites 

chatter of joggers . . .
the heron and I
motionless

nuit de mars 
écouter la pluie
s'écraser sur les carreaux 

quai de métro 
le mendiant ronfle
sa bouteille tient debout 

au coeur de la nuit
le ronron des ventilations
entre deux sirènes hurlantes 

premier jour d'automne 
le soleil frappe au carreau 
une dernière fois 

perdue dans le brouhaha
sur le quai d'en face
l'engueulade 

signature anonyme
vieilles empreintes de pigeon
dans le ciment nu 

lundi d'octobre
rentrer et sortir du métro
sans voir le jour 

métro du matin 
cette odeur d'urine 
tenace 

premières tâches rousses
sur le flanc de colline
soleil sur ma joue 

sommeil lourd
après son alcool de prunes
ramassées dans son jardin 

breathing deeply . . .
that smell of woodyards
in the rain

j'ai vu l'horizon
dans le métro
en quatre par trois 

le clapotis de la pluie
noie l'écho de mes pas
matin d'automne 

de pièce en pièce
la souris passe 
sans se soucier de nous 

thé glacé ou chaud 
j'hésite
dernier jour d'août 

elle ne l'est plus 
l'eau froide du robinet
canicule 

assis par terre 
son épaule dénudée 
sans bras 

trois bouts de cartons 
éparpillés 
restes de bonneteau 

un escargot s'aventure
sur le bitume encore chaud
orages de juin 

triste sandwich
tombé d'une machine
sans âme 

la seule lumière allumée 
dans une lutte passive 
contre l'obscurité de tout l'immeuble 

new snow
I almost forget
our quarrel

torse nu, fenêtre ouverte
je lis des haikus
pluie d'été 

rien qu'un instant
l'odeur des pins
en allant au travail 

early in the morning
looking at fog
after the wedding
au petit matin
regardant le brouillard
après le mariage 

more than the shining sun
in the morning
I want her

nothing more tiring
than being tired of sleeping alone
warm coffee

crushed mosquito
red line on the floor
subway in may

spring wind
on my neck
cooler than your breath

la pièce de monnaie
aussi froide que la machine
qui me l'a rendue 

en blouson noir
sous des arbres
aux fleurs roses 

dans la rame
toutes les senteurs du matin
éclipsées par le clochard endormi 

the stone bullfrog
under the bird feeder
just sits

blanches
les pages de mes carnets
je n'aime pas l'hiver 

nez en l'air
fixant l'invisible
le clochard perché 

écouter la pluie
à côté de mon téléphone
~ silencieux 

au lever
pisser dans le vent d'automne
en faire un haïku 

premiers flocons
penser à mon père
sur son lit d'hôpital 

mon lit froid
ma peau cherche la sienne
premiers flocons 

caressant le chat
une goutte froide
dans mon cou 

triste sourire
la raie du clodo qui dort
sur le quai du métro 

her plastic lifelines
in harsh hospital light -
even fresh flowers, fade

five star hotel -
a cockroach scurries
pool-side

my pregnant daughter
watches
the stone bullfrog

his old hands
working the soil -
smell of brewed tea::    ses vieilles mains
   travaillant le sol -
   odeur du thé infusé

on the clothesline
his and her shirts
side by side again

between the mist
and the edge of the forest
a white buffalo

harvest moon
rose garden
has lost its colors 

eerie moonlight
graveyard
of the rusted automobiles

indian summer
first light
finds the tallest tree

drought
no clouds
in the bird bath

tea party over
lipstick 
smiles remain

after the cloudburst
birdbath full
of sky again

underside
of the flower pot
one hundred legs

high tide
yesterday's footprints
gone

coffee season
singing
from the trees

no moisture
mother earths skin
has cracked

typing small i
only because morning coffee
occupies my other hand...

In the space-between
trees and mist
a white buffalo

drumming
heartbeat
in the mist

Mekong river--
the swaying of our hammocks

bone dust
after cremation
the winter sky

behind the cafe
the sound of children--
or crows 

rain scented air
a thousand frogs
croaking

black friday
dip-dyed desperation
gusting down the mall

snowmelt -
the garden blooms
with children's toys

customs' declaration -
only the memory
of eucalyptus

autumn gale
a month's mortgage payments
scatter the lawn 

Christmas Day
a present of rain
on the pony's back

november blossom --
a brightness to find
what might have been lost

deep autumn
there's wind enough to winnow
wild rice

shortening days ...
the petals fall
into dust

leaver's day
a wind too strong
for butterflies

endless rain
christmas lights
bleed in a puddle

gibbous moon
the smell of woodsmoke fills
a wait for rain

cider farm
a sweetness
on the breeze

neon veil
a neighbour's lights
outshine the moon

customs' declaration -
determining the value
of new haiku

yew harvest
deep hues fill
a redwing's hunger

autumn gale
the sunflowers turn
their seedy cheeks

she's leaving home
a pair of shoes
that no longer fit

indian summer
it's what the sunflowers
waited for

glinting on
a retirement card
autumn rain

autumn mist
my neighbour asks me
what I do

straw truck delivery
someone else's summer
strewn down our lane

autumn rain
my socks dry on
the pc tower

autumn equinox
i let the last fly
go free

after rain
honeysuckle
awake again

bonfire's glow
my niece cups her hands
around a firefly

summit cairn
a raven's call
lost to the wind

pathless moor
the cackle of grouse
hidden by mist

New Year's Day
a deer hesitates
in the headlights

dentist's chair
counting dead flies
in the striplights

the morning after
oak leaves cradle
last night's hail

hung in a cobweb
between gorse flowers
christmas rain

perseid showers
only rain in
the night garden

summer longing
a dampness in the washing
left out overnight

night after night
the farm dog forgets
he knows me of old

last day of term
my daughter breaks
the uniform code

after the rain a winter street full of moons


softening
my new jacket
spring rain

spring wind
tachograph discs
turn down a backroad 

steam railway
blackthorn blossom
follows the tracks

all fool's day
behaving like
a teenager again

day after day
on the road to work
a single magpie

spring sunshine
the jogger's stride
a little longer

my daughter says
i resemble a drunk
winter rain

St David's Day
a mower cuts the green
green grass of home 

efficiency seminar
a reek of cheap fat
lingers in the hall

referendum day
a few pale shoots
after the frost

après la pluie une rue d'hiver pleine de lunes 

roadside tribute
last year's leaves
cover a fox

black run
a skier's cigarette
points downhill

commuter traffic
no light to stop
a starling flock 

february gale
the empty bird feeder
taps my office window

i arrange my tie
to hide a stain
misty hollow

supermarket sign
the melancholia magnified
by drizzle

february dawn
the rhubarb rises
a deeper red

afternoon fog
the point of the meeting
getting lost

a red cloud
on the horizon
robin's song

valentine's day
a patch of snow
the sun hasn't found

marsh wren's cry
the sun ripples onto the mud

we race dry leaves
down the road home
the north wind and me 

jumping ice cubes
all over the floor
... a hair in my whiskey

new freedom
blue dress now
a table cloth

blowing bubbles
my breath floats away
in different sizes

three feet distance
needed for reading my ku
without glasses

langs zijderoute
dansende rupsencocons
in kokend water

her garden bench
she was always sitting----
butterfly on moss

a temple garden
snowy path to bronze bell
having deep footprints

wiping the full moon
from a wet glossy table
with my bare hand

flea market -
a sitting buddha
on his left side

northern lights
steam rises
from the coffee cup

Veterans' cemetery--
a wide expanse of lawn
beyond the graves.

late summer
an inchworm
less than an inch

talk of dying
the mention of ranch land
I have never seen

spring morning
flies return
to a crab carcass

migrating swallows
she tells me
she'll pray for me

letter from overseas
a call from southward geese
penetrates the thicket

spring mist
the tree I take shelter under
planted in remembrance

first raindrops
the freight train I passed
two states ago

hard winter ground -
we argue about
the constellations

walking to work -
the blossoms on my street
late this year

the smell of water between the iron pump and cup

snow outside
a small bowl
of imported oranges

abandoned house --
children picking mangoes
in the yard

A pear;
A worm's hole leaves
a bitter taste.

children dancing
circles in the rain-
autumn leaves

falling leaves-
unpacking winter clothes
from cedar trunks

summer heat
my air conditioner
sweating

summer's end-
one haiku becomes
another

Twin Towers-
where once two shadows
now only sun

rice seedlings-
each step deeper
in the mud

Fragrant spring blossom
children play outside until
there is no more light.

withered roses-- 
a bald woman waits 
for the taxi

Halloween night
ghosts and goblins
watch the rain

desert wind
the potter's fingerprints
on an ancient shard

together
we watch the eclipse
far apart

faded asters
the cortege pauses at her gate
moves on

biopsy
just a cyst - this time
a break in the clouds

plastic flowers
placed beside the highway
memory fades

dead cat...
open-mouthed
to the pouring rain

mud puddles
leaving behind
a high heel

waiting for the train
a huddled mass
of smartphones 

zazen—
that fly battering itself
against the sunny window

dusk--
the mason jar filled
with fireflies

morning meditation -- 
a steaming
manhole cover

winter rain --
the dog and I
exchange sighs

pure blue --
a broken
robin's egg

asleep at the wheel
the ghost cabbie
of my nightmares

gibbous moon --
she's not telling
the whole truth

two-hour meeting --
shadows creep
across the table

frost on the windshield --
I remember how much
I drank last night

budget cuts --
a crescent moon
on the horizon

Ash Wednesday --
a dusting
of snow

police sirens --
another night
without the moon

love letters -
i rake the embers
of the fire

crashing waves-
my thoughts move
with the tide

final approach -
she pencils in
her eyebrows

melting snow -
an unfinished
haiku

the Dow falls -
rose petals
in the wind

between doses
of cough medicine
silence

snow flurries -
my unborn grandchild's
perfect fingers

stuck behind
a schoolbus -
thunderclouds

crescent moon -
leaning her head
against my shoulder

icy conditions -
another slide
on Wall Street

converting to condos
the nightclub
where we met

in a dark place
quietly fermenting
homebrew

in the attic
the sound of march rain
so much louder

graffiti glistening in the flickering streetlight 

new moon -
time to lose
the beard

emptying the wine bottle -
another conversation
about Mom

my stock portfolio -
puddles filled
with winter rain

occupying Wall Street
the ghosts
of my retirement dreams

that recurring dream
in which I pull the fire alarm
and run

epiphany -
Jesus and Mary
stopped at the border

epiphany -
the gift of a dead mouse
at the door

not softened
by sepia tones
images of war

first thaw -
someone should have warned
the daffodils

hot day--
the cool inside
an apple

snow turns to rain -
wondering when
it all went wrong

war -
fathers
burying sons

domestic terrorism --
winter moths
at the door

harvest moon --
grass gone to seed
on the tennis court

huddled smokers --
another conversation
about The Cloud

hazard lights
through raindrops
October leaves

cold stethoscope --
I lie to the doctor
about my drinking

starless night --
I can't believe
the weekend is over

after the rain
a puddle filled
with stars

abandoned school --
a soft breeze ripples
through the weeds

her small fingers
tightly grip the pencil
--writing her new name

after the conference
pigeons feasting
on crumbs

still pond --
a dragonfly lands
on the moon

severe thunderstorm warning --
a murder
of crows 

daylight fades --
my mother asks
the same question twice

ghost town -- 
a rooster crows
for no reason at all

end of the road --
three big dogs
with nothing to do

an oasis
in the Bible Belt --
adult book store 

after the storm
the streets
have no names

early autumn --
the golden highlights
in her green hair

half moon --
something
I'm forgetting

house for sale--
the dandelions allowed
to bloom

mixed precipitation --
a flat finish
on Wall Street

a long meeting --
permanent marker
on the erasble whiteboard

sipping absinthe
the impressionist painting
of night

urban incense --
a steaming
manhole cover

sailing the seas
of my subconscious --
her fishnet stockings

cold snap --
the junkyard dog's
heavy chain

wolf moon --
suddenly I see her
in a different light

laundry day --
the search
for matching socks

Christmas leftovers --
my mother forgets
why she called

the sudden chill--
a fresh layer of ice
on the fire escape

looking for something
in the bottom of a cup
the low autumn sun

bad beer --
the stock market
goes flat

mixed precipitation --
she tells me I look good
for my age

enlightment --
a police car
on fire

Thanksgiving night --
an empty parking lot
at the nursing home

Thanksgiving rain --
the unblinking eyes
of a shelter dog

Thanksgiving rain --
the dog
no one wanted

alone at the bar
the missing letters
in a neon light

new moon --
the doctor schedules
a biopsy

morning fog --
an empty
tequila bottle

asleep
on the subway floor
the unknown soldier

a granita before
the afternoon shift
short shadows

Veteran's Day --
the old dog's
gray muzzle

Dia de los Muertos --
her elegant cheek bones

on a cold night
the hollow echo of your voice

now available
in HD

under attic dust
another unopened envelope

a child's balloon
above the clouds

spring mist --
my granddaughter cries
in my arms

a sudden chill --
my credit card
declined

Patriot's Day --
a homeless veteran's
weathered sign

dusk --
that song
still makes me cry

two moons
somewhere between ports
she tells him it's over

Holy Week --
three bare trees
against a gray sky

morning mist --
the fragrance
of strong coffee

bitter wine --
time for that conversation
about Mom

the old oak tree
where we first kissed
marked with an "X"

of my granddaughter --
crocuses in bloom

twilight --
she tells me she has
a spare toothbrush

the fullness
of her hips

koi swim
through the sky

my mother
serves me decaf

things best said
in a letter

splitting
the last of the wine

still wandering

cheap perfume

beware of falling
stock prices

headline news
for ghosts

the sway
of her hips

an unscratched
lottery ticket

a clash
of perfumes

forgetting
old acquaintances

learning nothing
from the pine

the graffiti
fades

all along the promenade
cicadas and ringtones

trying not to talk
to her cleavage

with one eye open

highway billboard

my unborn granddaughter's
heartbeat

the final hours
of the weekend 

the moon
and my wine glass
half full

old timers
arguing politics

in the intersection

my wife begins
to cradle her belly

too hot to shop
wasps drinking from
a town fountain

all the leftover
Halloween candy

searching
for my keys

cold night --
I become
the dog's pillow

first snow --
an almost
perfect shave

fair-weather clouds --
an ultrasound
of my next grandchild

a true wonder of the world --
how she fills
her Grand Canyon t-shirt

my rising blood pressure -
a vapor trail
in the sky

hot city night --
the sizzle
of a broken sub-woofer

loosening
the top button of her blouse
with my eyes

snow turns to rain --
the afterglow
of the plow lights

our parting kiss
a mixture of salt
and sweet peppers

snow day --
more white than I remember
in my beard

footprints in the snow
words
I can't take back

New London winter --
the gleam of pleasure boats
wrapped in plastic

winter chill -
shredded plastic
in a barbed wire fence

lazy midtown morning -
another layer of paint
on the rusty fire escape 

lazy midtown morning -
do those green copper gargoyles
feel the cold? 

first of December -
the darkness
before dawn

first of December -
police tape clinging
to a burned-out barn

first of December -
another cold cup
of coffee

winter clouds -
my gray hair
grayer

October rain 
all through the night 
my kidney stone

December rain -
the long night
longer

a break in the clouds --
my third cup of coffee
grows cold

clear skies --
a solitary crow
on a high-voltage wire

November dusk --
do the streetlights know
how early it is?

November dusk --
the warmth
of a familiar song

overcast --
just one more game
of solitaire

more rain --
a mouse trapped
between walls

new moon --
an abandoned car
on lover's lane

new moon --
a missing
mouse trap

the mouse in the ceiling
awakens

the soldier looks
back over his shoulder
autumn grass

my baseball glove
right where I left it

an empty bird feeder
outside the nursing home

a hand-printed sign reads:
"lost dog"

our new neighbors'
argument

the dog moves slowly
from shadow to shadow

a tree frog
in and out of tune

is good enough

stars obscured
by distant smoke

red dragonfly --
my newest granddaughter's
tiny fingers

June cold snap
the next-door neighbor's
house for sale

half-way home
a pint of stout
to keep out the cold

after the rain
a light on in the basement
of an empty house

finally Friday --
the dog so attentive
around the grill

cold April rain --
I no longer remember
your name

cold April rain --
my daughter's birthday
on another continent

cold April rain --
the sediment
at the bottom
of a wine glass

going out of business — 
the naked mannequin’s 
Mardi Gras beads

caffeine buzz --
snow in the forecast
somewhere else

moonless night --
an ambulance speeds by
with its lights out

moonless night --
an empty can
of whipped cream

moonless night --
pulling the dog
from shadow to shadow

in from the cold
just one sugar cube more
in my coffee

too wired to sleep
too tired to dream
winter wind

crowded train --
her perfect lips
pierced

autumn rain --
the warmth of one too many
glasses of wine 

wolf moon --
the dog
won’t come in

blue moon --
I wonder where my children
are tonight ?

bitter cold —
even the Christmas lights
seem to shiver

December rain —
a phone call
from my son

December rain —
a deer tail
and then nothing

April overcast --
my son turns twenty
in Iraq

March --
a broken umbrella
crosses the street

drawn in by the smell
of fast food and vinegar
this october sun 

deep winter --
a stray dog sniffs
an empty coffee cup

late train --
all the highlighted passages
in his bible

one week before Christmas
a three-legged dog
sniffs the trash

the drunk offers me his seat
for five dollars

new graffiti
on an old caboose

two limes
in my margarita

a frightened dog
at the animal shelter

I direct a stranger
to the wrong train

from the dog

a lone wasp explores
the apple press

removing decorations
from the Christmas tree

troubled sleep --
steam rises
from a storm sewer

my daughter's 18th birthday --
the warming sunshine
in her hair

the unnerving plunge
of her neckline

stood up
by a part-time lover --
shooting star

orthopedist's office --
all paintings tilted
slightly off center

afghan invasion --
the dog
on my side of the bed

approaching storm --
my twelve year-old's fascination
with war

Autumn colors --
the receptionist's
bright red hair

first frost --
I trim
my graying beard

first buttercup
three lines of coke
on the kitchen table

three shades too dark
the lipstick
on his collar

a familar name
on the victims list --
my coffee grows cold

between
silent construction cranes
the Milky Way

the end of summer --
my light beer
suddenly darker

my daughter starts college --
another empty
pint of beer

first day of vacation --
shooting star
on a moonless night

train running late
an ant climbs
the station wall

planning our trip
lightning flashes
beyond the horizon

distant thunder --
a shower of pollen
falls from the trees

the haze lifts --
she tosses her hair
over her shoulder

chrysanthamums
the homeless girl pulls
her baby closer

dangerous lightning --
she watches me
watching her

unhooking her bra
the moon peeks
over the treetops

my daughter's graduation
tightening the knot
on my necktie

crowded train station --
the tap tap thump
of a blind man's cane

mist turns to rain
our cat's last day

staring at me
from the bathroom mirror
an age spot

my son's twelfth birthday
a rabbit hops
across the busy street

sunny spring day
walking through a cloud
of perfume

the train arrives
one more sip
from an empty cup of coffee

wedding night
the parents of the bride
in separate beds

alba brumosa
funghi rossi crescono
fra le tombe

a second glass of wine -
the poem goes
unwritten

tube ride
someone else's iPod
is playing our tune

Spring snow --
an expecting mother rests
her hands on her belly

energy crisis --
long line
at the coffee shop

Ash Wednesday --
the priest
lights a cigarette

where dirty snow
meets road salt
a dozen roses

after so many thorns
a rare and perfect rose

snow mixes with rain --
my mother keeps calling me
by my brother's name

away on business --
the restless cat
on your side of the bed

lunch hour --
the automatic teller machine
eats my card

staring at her neckline
the deep plunge
of the NASDAQ

the NASDAQ falls --
moss clings
to a weathered tombstone

 too hot to sleep
i search for my son's footprint
in the front drive

troubled sleep --
somewhere in the darkness
an unlocked door

commuter daydream --
I follow the slit in her skirt
into oncoming trafic

her well-tanned shoulders
wrapped in a sweater --
the end of summer

asleep on the train
the gentle rise and fall
of her breasts

first date --
under the streetlight
our shadows hold hands

tent revival
the preacher's wife
in a miracle bra

Mass Pike trafic
the bright red glare
of her lipstick

reflecting
the graffiti landscape
Soho rain

my son's eleventh birthday --
miles of cold gray rain
between us

in the produce aisle
a voluptuous woman
compares melons

working late
the sound of a small brown moth
in the lampshade

market forecast:
record warmth
followed by rain

bitterly cold
a box of old love letters
hidden in the attic

after four hours of sleep
light snow fills
an empty cup

cold starry night -
from the forest edge the sound
of animal kill

temple courtyard
through the morning fog
peach blossoms

english newspaper
a lot of starving people
between fish  chips

while dusting buddha's mouth
is smile disappeared
for a few seconds

autumn storm
lightning flashes
on buddah's belly

new cracks
in an old mirror
I just noticed

tree less corners
the tall shadows
of beer bottles

hedgerow birds

autumn chill--
time for a hot bowl
of chili

frozen pond--
the moon trapped
in a crack

chilled by spring winds
schoolgirls sniffing body spray
behind the gym

November night--
the smell of burning leaves
and marshmallows

high summer--
the sounds and smells
of a traveling fair

gentle breaths--
the window's
frost etchings

quiet lake--
the only sound
a jumping fish

meteor shower--
in the cold our gasps
become visible

failing light--
the ash tree
heavy with  birds

fall equinox--
another day
in the  90's

evening   news--
the burden of  snow
on my son's   balcony

under the snowpack
the garden  buddha
still keeps his smile

stoplight
each of us tapping
to our own beat

credit crunch -
a half-dozen fireworks
greet the new year

a lost child
in a ward of iron lungs
her daffodils

Mass over--
the rush to be first
out of the lot

5am--
bird songs lost
in air conditioner noise

guided hike~
beyond the talk
quiet woods

at the feeder
more birds than room
the smell of snow

midwinter vanished
in a bite of homemade
strawberry preserves

while washing spinach
how nice to find
a haiku there

at the end
of a long learning curve
a helmut of white hair

bamboo flute
the scent
of green tea

Ashes, what was once a man, and the full moon. Bright, big, yellow.

empty room -- 
endless TV ads 
for nobody

almost home
the full moon between
two houses

pastry shop --
so many candy smiles
around me

summer's end -
under a lamp on the path
a moth's dying

parking for lovers --
many crocuses between
the wheel's traces

funeral procession
of the friend passes --
the crocus field

playing bowls,
playing at cards ...
old warriors

driving towards
crematorium along
the frozen road

Independence Day
after the rainy morning
a sunny afternoon

autumn equinox --
fox's eyes shining
in the twilight

overturned boat,
drawn high on the shore -
drumming of rain

meteor shower --
crickets occupied
by its song

chilly tea-time --
finding new cyclamen leaves
in an old plant-pot.

watching Perseids --
a moth makes noise
on the porch

moths fluttering
in the paper lantern ?
a shadow play

nobody's here -
only a cricket guards
the alpine hut

long lasting rain -
the dog-rose petals clung
to the pavement

summer's end  -
under a lamp on the path
a moth's dying

summer's end .
their chirping slows down -
good-bye, cicadas!

above the cemetery
laser beams from the disco --
a calm cricket chirp

the rose hides
the date of death
on her grave

sultry twilight --
pauses between bird's singing
become longer

courtyard of my childhood --
after so many dead people
the old lilac in bloom

afternoon tea --
the old climbing rose
somehow whiter

under floating clouds
the cherry blossom snow --
in the same direction

I completely forgot
the magnolia-tree,
till its bloom

I light on again
the candle on her grave
extuinguished by wind

first crowing
breaks my sleep --
year of Rooster

drinking mulled wine
on the square --
white breaths

late harvester --
sickle moon in the sky
over the mature corn

deep in the night
my computer turned off --
sound of autumn rain

crickets' songs
in the pitch-dark night --
how many secrets

nobody here
a table in the mountain
speckled with petals

 trains come and go
but the same people
drinks at bar

Eucharist
pious women still weeping
for Jesus 

little pawprints
in the concrete
from the lost kitten

brightening sky
the low from street lamps
still lingers
your late night words
suffuse my day with warmth

before my door
your footprints in the snow
from last night
how to absorb these echoes
of what we shared

her father's grave -
the little girl leaves a picture
of a dinosaur

Handel's Messiah
the same tapes my late-grandmother
listened to

late afternoon -
the fulness
of the cow's udder

late summer
butterfly wings clap
a little slower

full moon--
pumpkins in the field
ready to pick

overcast-
curls of smoke
over a shared fence

New Year's Eve--
the warmth of his eyes
over cold champagne

winter wonderland
even the burnt out car
looks beautiful

solstice birthday--
blowing out a candle
for each decade

overcast day. . .
even the poppies
stay curled up

early dawn...
I watch the New Year
spill down the mountain

our greeting
between the honks
returning geese

clouds lifting
above the archipelago
morning light

the owl's whoo
unanswered
this autumn night

autumn morning
spreading marmalade
over burnt toast

autumn sun
slides through the blinds
withered sunflowers

candlelit pumpkin
the moths reflection
in the cat's eyes

New Year's Eve--
bubbles rise again
in the old crystal flutes

almost Christmas ~
thinking how best to reveal
that dad beats mum

at dusk...
the sweetness
of the roses

winter pears--
eating around
the bruises

gibbous moon--
the baby stirs
in her belly

autumn deepens--
dusting off an old
bottle of port

election results--
low tide clams
spit seawater

evening walk--
acorn shells crunch
into the silence

empty bus stop--
autumn leaves swirl
in the car's wake

flu season--
to kiss
or not to kiss?

drought-
weeds sprouting
near the sprinkler

death watch...
I freshen the water
of her bedside iris

circle time
she describes her mother
finding a vein

at the cottage . . .
last year's mosquitoes
on the bedroom wall

spring cleaning . . .
painting over
last year's mosquitoes

midnight.
the stallion's single kick
against the wall

quiet stable...
the sudden force
of horse piss

drought...
the first raindrops
bounce

overcast -
the next door pianist
hits a sour note

downpour -
the pumpkin's smile
goes out

we sip sweet tea
in silence. . .
a soldier's mother

autumn visit -
over war news we talk
of babies . . .

fireside -
a son's face smiles down
from the mantelpiece

setting gibbous moon a golden jellyfish drifts under our kayak

in the yard
between our argument -
a red dragonfly

more rain -
mildew colors
the old roof

half asleep -
the rhythm of the
receding rain

wild iris
in the marsh
unreachable

night rain -
Chopin's nocturne
drowns it out 

summer rain -
lightning whites out
the street lights

the crow -
balancing on a wire
and now, in the wind

midnight -
only jasmine now
and cricket song

equinox -
the bulbul's song on the edge
between day and night

spring evening -
a boy hums the tune I heard
half a mile ago

Valentine's Day
a forsythia
without birds

tattered clouds -
the moon's whiteness is
icier tonight

unaimed day -
beneath the flipped stone
five black beetles 

cricket song
softly, outlasting
the trucks

red poppies...
the butterfly always just
out of reach

night silence -
despite the dogs, despite
a crying baby

monsoon clouds - 
a heron bathes in a pool
of light

night rain
a bat wings its way to
tomorrow

unhurried
the egret whiter
than the clouds

veins of lightning
split the sky - 
smell of wet earth

moonless
suddenly the silence
bigbangs into barking

head cold -
missing the scent
of winter heliotrope

early spring air
all day long
our beds not made

rain on leaves tiles earth 
flute notes slither through
the water sounds 

grey-yellow dawn
a dove's urgent cooing
and the rain

still night -
the smell of fried fish drowns out
the traffic sounds

through the window
half a mirror showing
a quarter room

cool breeze -
a thousand things undone
I watch the moon

storm-washed sky -
the bird songs
clearer

midnight -
my earphones
keep out the silence

darkening street -
two babblers on a wire
and then the moon

midnight -
the windy silence
of the sickle moon

after the solstice
this summer heat
still the same

husband away
washing his socks
by hand

night drizzle
is that donkey's braying
filled with pain?

hot oil sizzles
on an iron frying pan
kitchen god speaks

darkening trees -
a flight of parakeets
brightly lit

silver moon
a loudspeaker barks
at the night

midday heat - 
the insistent call
of a dove

noon heat - 
a pigeon shadow shimmers
across the tar

unanswered
the dog's howl fades
into the night

roadside cricket song - 
the full moon's risen
above the wires

day of remembrance -
the night silence
same as always

Internet break - 

between memories
and the parents' grave
the curtain of rain

evening voices
the moon
so huge

rusty fence - 
a sunbird
in one of the diamonds

the rising moon pales
down here the cricket's
unwavering song 

high-stepping,
an egret walks its shadow
across a white wall

bulbul blues
a yellow flower floats
in my tea cup

lakeside
the long silence
before the loon's reply

getting the phone - 
the soft tapping
of the rocking chair

rabbit in the moon
each dog has the last bark
till the next

cold night
a cricket's
insistent mantra

cloudy
the metal-edged whistle
of a dove's flight

my sweaty skin --
enough for three weeks
his ironed shirts

moon-paved road
I take the lane
without the dogs

haze over the hills
the rain has filled
this morning's footprints

night silence
a facebook cry
of loneliness

deep silence
that crack in the wall
looks wider tonight

the moon's emerged
now water drips only
under the trees 

last light
listening for the silence
behind the rain

night rain -
baking smells from the house
with the jasmine

brown earth
a hawk's reflection glides
across the puddle

rain on the leaves
just one
firefly

night rain
a bus rumbles through
the croaking of frogs

broken
magnolia bloom
still inviting bees

red sun
the air glitters
with dragonflies

dim porch light
I spit orange seeds
into the darkness

shrilling cicadas
two women smile
at something else

between fiery clouds
and shadowed earth
a string of egrets

another year
the inscription hard to read
with all the grass

naked light bulb
the rain on the leaves
barely audible

roosting egrets
the lake's silence settles
on everything

petal-strewn earth
a mynah hops into
a patch of sunlight

declining moon
the old man's laughter
turns to coughing

February chill
a punctured heart balloon
bright red in the dust

beggar's steps
at the bakery
slower and slower

darkening trees
the steady shrilling
of cicadas

election results
the muezzin's call
like a lament

almost full moon
knowing what's for dinner
I still check it out

same moon
same song
another cricket

rumble of thunder
the hawk-like flight
of the pigeon

starry fireworks
a smoke cloud
drifts past Orion

night walk
I slow down
near the jasmine bush

Beware Of Dog sign
the bright pink tongue
of the puppy

cold sky
after my friend's cremation
I water the garden

a cricket falls silent
the clock's slow ticking
goes on

bus stop -
all eyes
on the migrating geese

morning mist
the sun does not reach
the side lane

now what?
the papaya tree has reached
the cement awning

past midnight
and a dripping tap
a man's voice somewhere

neon light
the leaves of the bush
almost black

wedding band --
smoke from the fireworks
dissolves against the stars

half-empty train
the hand-holds sway
in unison

a break in the clouds
spider webs and plastic bags
catch the morning light

blackout:
morning glories appear
in the car's headlights

distant temple drums
close by the sound of a dog
shaking itself

hot night -
after my bath
the world seems cleaner

dusk-
fireflies leading the way
to the car door

steaming tea
dusty cobwebs above
the late owner's photo

lemon slice moon
a kite glides past
the palmyra palm

cycle cart -
the office chairs' legs
point to the moon

muezzin's call
a kite's silhouette
beneath orange clouds

muezzin's call
a one-horned cow pushes
at the hotel gate

smoky moon
a cricket's regular chirp
between the traffic noise

fluffed-up sparrows
the air white with snowflakes
above the tar

anti-war demo
snowflakes melt
on the horse's backside

cold rain
a bunch of daffodils
against the brick wall

blinding snow
man and dog tracks
run together

in the mirror

in union square

along the sidewalk --
hint of frost

the half moon

undecided voter
half a moon hangs
in the noon sky

in the phone cord again

i wish i could give you the moon
instead

starts singing

autumn chill
her long fingernails drum
with the rain

farmer's market
checking out the guy
checking me out

stage a riot

she fingers the wool
of his last chemo cap

over the chair

about his fresh fruit

out to sea

crescents of cantaloupe
on a blue plate

the warmth of his lips
on mine

over the road kill

phase terminale
près du lit une infirmière
lit un conte de fées.

lourdeur de juillet
une sans-abri s'évente
avec du carton

lit défait
un sourire sur le bord
de la flûte vide

minus forty-six
steam from the coffee
warms my nose

équinoxe
toutes les couleurs de l'automne
dans le ciel

Solstice d'hiver --
essence de mandarine
dans l'eau de mon bain

Chambre anonyme
ombre éclaboussant de gris
la femme sans nom

Miel et café ~
odeur corsée imprégnant
les draps froissés

Vagues sur la plage
bruit des galets roulant
sous notre étreinte

discount store --
the unfinished tatoo
on the cashier's arm

Travail au jardin
odeur chaude de sueur
et d'origan

autumn's end
the air smells
different

candlelight bath
the steam rises
from my toes

Jouseki ni Jizo nokorite Yuki no koe

Futo ni Furansu to kaku Yuki moyohi

Mimi kakishi
Ato mata muon
Miyukibare

Now the shore is grey
and the wind is sharp with rain.
Some day we'll sit close
on these white rocks, talking of
nothing in particular.

in a shoebox
all the candles
of uncelebrated birthdays

breezy afternoon
  running my hands
  across the cool sheets


moonlit night
across the meadow
my shadow grows

summer dust --
a caterpillar under
the whale bone arch

after the storm
puddles of water
with rainbows

alone
in the tea house
rainy night

black ice
covers the street
uprooted tree

a butterfly
hovers above me
friend's funeral

sad words
and tears in my teacup
rainstorm

moldy odors
in the nursing home
dying elders

mason jar
full of dead fireflies
dark night

lost in her mind
fields of white daisies
and summer

only two pinecones
on the park bench ~
Valentine's day

Still under white sheet
his body four hours later-
Rain beats on pavement.

giorni più brevi
nella cesta dei cachi
un grillo morto

Sunday best
his overalls
washed and ironed

a white night --
salmon bones
curled against a log

cool night air
city noises fade away
memories

cool night air
folding chair
meditations

market day
hot tired shoppers
wait for the free bus

call to prayer
roosters too
fresh morning air

dog barks
somebody starts their car
summer's morning light

memorial day weekend
watering plants
remembering 

deer carcass
alongside the highway
silently accepts the rainstorm

is spring coming
bombs raining down
on tripoli on aljazeera

w?nter sesshin
in the kitchen
my cracked teacup

after winter sesshin
sharing tea
silence

scent of new leaves --
a caterpillar swings
in a shaft of light

winter's cold
dreaming
of my ex-wife

the sulphuric scent
of winter coal
out for a walk

sometimes
sunny sundays in november
are unfair

sunny sunday in november
half assembled shelves
wait in the kitchen

sunday in autumn
neighbor needs money
for her cancer meds

november email
remembering sycamores
outside the window

october over
listening to heavy rain
call to prayer

heavy steady rain
back pain
skipped friday prayer

heavy steady rain
through windows through wet trees
the lake in the rain

passover
moon
through the bare branches

half-frog pose
I lie and listen
to the rain

The Holy Land
no heat no food no water
craters

new fire old coals
in the old stove
new year

rainstorm
guests huddle with candles
waiting for dinner

after an hour of rain
the crickets
all seem happy

kumquats with Russian tea
then slowly
I undress Ellen

in the hyacinth garden
I sneak a kiss
between Jimmy's lips

September 11th
steady slow soft
rain

full moon
full ripe figs
end of summer

solstice
after the last match
the last call to prayer

spring
full moon
new roses

spring currents --
the first gulls
picking bones

at anchor      tankers        wide blue sea white sky
à l'ancre       des pétroliers   mer bleue immense  ciel blanc

all night long on the veranda
drinking tea and talking
about God and our new parrot

picking flowers
an explosion of color
crosses the minefield

a thousand prayers
from valley folds and mountains
paper cranes

Spring rain-
I sit looking
out the window

cold nose
burrow of warm flannel -
morning light

cherry trees
fifty shades
of pink

one small step... 
I trace my toe in sand 
dream of lunar dust

Mother's Day;
the smell of roses
near a grave.

winter twilight -
she studies the face
in her mirror

a hawk searches
the dry grass --
sundogs

just one more page
before I sleep...
endless rain

winter rain...
she places his flowers
in the second-best vase

fading light -
a red leaf bouquet
at the smallest grave

spring rain -
as the doctor speaks
i think of lilacs

false dawn
sometimes i still
think of home

first frost -
a twirl of yellow leaves
as the bus passes

plasma tv -
in high resolution
the homeless man's face

sparrow song--
two ladies on the verandah
just before the rain

summer wind
the blue jay's reflection
in the birdbath

Right, left
The flash of the float plane's light
Rain on the forest 

the courtship songs
of so many birds --
wind through my shirt

the crunch
of the first leaf
a sweet sigh

the sound
of the first fallen leaf
this Autumn day

2 am
rain and wind on the island
another insomnia night

Soft rain
her thoughts of lost love
intrude into her day

He looks at her
underlying chill in the air
smell of rain

Another day without him
she misses all the little things
still, the sun shines

3 am
a scycle moon 
thoughts of him
crowd my brain
and takes my sleep 

cancer clinic visit
day breaking from the night
a seaplane is waiting

feelings of joy
float in and out
red seaweed 

Counting the shades
of grey in the sea
and in his hair
Comptant les teintes
de gris de la mer
et de ses cheveux 

scent of rain --
a whale-shaped cloud
hangs over the bay

On the pillow
his bouquet of wild flowers
this last day of Spring

Dusting off the ancestors
and stirring up memories
Spring cleaning
je dépoussière les ancêtres
et aspire les souvenirs
nettoyage de printemps 

Another day of rain
her tears fall also
which is which
Un autre jour de pluie
ses larmes tombent aussi
laquelle est laquelle 

waiting for the sun
the clouds hide his face
first cup of coffee

awake at 3 am
she drags her kimono
from room to room
éveillée à 3 heures du matin
elle traîne son kimono
de chambre en chambre 

Cancer clinic visit
a bald woman passes by
with a smile
visite à la clinique du cancer
une femme chauve passe
avec un sourire 

a milky sea
mass of logs sit and rest
as an eagle soars 

finally a day of sun
here in the rain forest
freckles on my face

From the tidal pool
Two crabs in an embrace
Today's lunch

Buddhist monks chat
On the 49th day of the disaster
Looking for lost souls

lulled to sleep
by gutter sounds --
spring dreaming

Dawn
The night separating from the day
A bird's song

On the table
Apple blossom branches
A new scent

Forever waiting
For the ring of the phone
Watching the rain

In the hospital
Watching the clouds drift by
Sharp needle in the hand

Grey and rainy
Going with my Mother
To a senior's complex

Soft rain
My Mother and I look
At retirement homes

Rainy February day
Cloud after cloud after cloud
Pray for a clear day

Chilly morning
Memories of a love affair
Floating in my mind

Home again
His scent lingers
On her kimono

Awoken at 4 am
The honking of Canada geese
Spring is here

a cold morning --
goose honks echo
off the pavement

Snowballs
her seasonal cookies
eaten one by one

Grey surrounds
wind blows in from the window 
Advents candles blow out

Winter solstice
too many things to do
this shortest of days

On the island
the first snowfall
red gloves

First mandarin
sweet and sour taste
scent of Christmas

Side of the road
flowers a deep shade of blue
thoughts fly to you

A wind up frog
hops across the wooden floor
thoughts of haiku 

On the weight scale
too many extra pounds
Autumn's abundance

Summer's day
the clink of ice cubes
in my gin and tonic

Crunch, crunch, crunch
stepping on fallen acorns
this Autumn day 

steamed milk --
snowmelt running from
the coffee shop roof

Rain clouds
patches of blue in the sky
first cup of coffee

In the morning darkness
coffee cup in hand
missing the sunshine

Fall morning
fog resting on cedars
cup of Kona

Fall afternoon
the boat on the river
slow heart beating

Hazy skies
the cedars less dark
this Summer day

Crickets in the garden
time passing me by
Mother's ageing hands 

My son's birthday
not sharing the cake
chasing the seagull away 

cloudless night
she looks into the mirror
counting new wrinkles

Cloudy sky
the sun a bright red
first cup of coffee

(Rain filled morning
i hold my face upward
tears like rain

conformation
the steady drip...drip...drip...drip...
of maple sap 

between the yoga
and chi gung classes --
scent of burning sage

Cool and cloudy day
slowly the season changes
mirrored in your eyes

visit to the old villa
the scent of
lost money

After the Solstice
already feeling the touch
of Winter

The red breasted bird
outside the cancer clinic 
Spring nest building now 

Dark spring morning
busy conversation of birds
awakens interest

Morning sunshine bright
chases all worry from cancer
operation success 

Dancing in the yard
rows of tidy daffodils
oh so very yellow

A float plane
divides the Canada geese
Summer stillness

Summer solstice
the smoke of bonfires
hill after hill

Spring cleaning today
dead ladybug on the window
memory of lost love

dawn storm --
a bit of mountain ash
stirred into the snow

Cold sea
and warm air merge
fog horns

scent of seaweed
drifts into the cemetery
i walk alone

In the cemetary
around his headstone
first snowdrops

a slow walk
to the cemetery
memory of blue irises 

Through the fog
a few spots of red
first Robins

Old chestnut tree
white candles sway
Spring wind

Ides of March
her letter to him
pain in his heart

Lights of the ferry --
leave the island of cedars
in deep dark shadow

The full December moon
he counts his birthdays
snow on the temple

The Advent wreath
candles lighting the dim room
his old eyes shinning

horizonless --
sky-colored ice
turns in the bay

November morning --
counting the many
shades  of grey

Chilly morning --
mountains topped with first snow
warm coffee cup

Snow covered temple --
lone woman in a red coat
kneels to pray anyway

Indian Summer --
his voice in the fall
of the leaves

Through the  pulp mill smoke
A long red line is showing --
Start of a sunrise

The rushing river --
full of the Summer's
rainfall

The Budapest square --
Autumn leaves drift  here and there
on  young protestors

Dark August sky
the moon an orange egg --
her shadow trailing

Summer morning --
the sound of wind chimes
on every balcony

This Dark and grey day --
a soft rain falling down on
the heat-dried roses

sharp air --
the patch of blue
changes shape

Tonight on my deck
setting sun the longest time
bring memories back

Rain-laden cedars
my skin feels so moist today
scent of yellow rose

On this dark grey day
my thoughts wander to a pair
of  blue irises

A bone scan today
on the way three birds on the
rose scented old path

Hovering grey sky
a small crack in the thick clouds
fishing boats come in

Late night jazz
the singer's voice sounds dark
in the smoky cafe

la voix du chanteur semble noire
dans le café enfumé

Five years of haiku
in a  large paper box
on top, the cat

The morning birds
such a clear sweet sound --
making my bed

A Rainy cool day
promise of Kona coffee
from Honolulu

daylight moon --
the shadows of bubbles
under the ice

Belated and elated
your gift of a blue candle
for my birthday

In the early morning
down on the white beach --
a turtle without eyes

Heavy March rain
the Daffodils hang their heads
my heavy thoughts

Clear Spring night
again i am thinking of you
waiting for stars to fall

Moon over cedars
in the rainforest
scent of you

Cherry blossoms
patients line up at the clinic
sweet scent

In the rainforst
moss hung trees
sound of silence

I check the calendar
to see if this is a special day --
International Women's Day

Late Winter
the yellow roses still  out
soft feel of snow

In a vase
twelve blue irises
late winter storm

fog patches --
a second little face
in the sonogram

March sunrise
rays of red and gold through clouds
a fishing boat returns

Yellow Winter roses
mist over the garden
sound of fog horn

At midnight
the fog horn in the mist
yellow roses

What was a storm
now lies wet and white
on the ground

Spring day
cool and grey
cup of tea

Grey today
the waves rush
memories

Spring morning
your hand on my breast
a bird

Parting the fog
blue nose of the ferry
homeward bound

Autumn sky
many layers of clouds
pile of leaves

Autumn sky
shades of pink and purple
field of pumkins

spin cycle --
snow flakes swirl outside
the laundromat

First day of autumn
splash of a spawning salmon
another cycle begins

Last day of September
bay and islands in fog
aroma of coffee

First day of October
the morning sun in my eyes
clank of the furnace

A fine mist
covers the tall cedars
foggy glasses

At breakfast
after first sip of coffee
i notice a rainbow

Wild fires rage
scent of cedar
fills the air

Over the bay
August full moon rises
as days shorten

Reading a book
a sudden brightness
the full moon

High winds
trees down on power lines
no morning coffee

On a grey day
a spot of colour
his red hair

lifting fog --
a few white feathers
in the raven's breast

In the room
white lillies in the vase
scent of pepper

Federal Express
reaches me through the fog
plumeria lei

Talking with you
now this morning somehow
scent of plumeria

Red as the poppy
maple leaves fall
on the memorial

Light-studded ferry
passes in the starless night
another week-end

A tunnel of fog
connects the two islands
warmth of my duvet

October morning
a new pair of new wool socks
on my very cold feet

First day of Autumn
even your touch feels
somewhat cooler

Last night of Summer
the bright full moon of last night
hidden by a cloud

All my lights off
to watch the rising
of the Harvest moon

bank thermometers --
the temperature changes
all the way home

The sunrise
fresh salmon on ice
so very pink

Midnight and full moon
my neighbour asks to borrow
the vacum cleaner

The blue iris
colour changing hue
soft Summer rain

A sea change
the weather turns cool
hot rum and lemon

At last some sunshine
blue Pacifc this morning
boiling tea water

In this desert
a memory of blue sea --
shells in the sand

Autumn mist obscures
the island in the distance
she cleans her glasses

In the forest
patches of blue between
the tall pines

The tall pines
etched against the sky
late September

Nun and monk
watching the blue heron
fishing in the bay

subzero --
the icicles filled
with moonlight

Nun and monk
read the book together
in two tongues

The curved cheek
of the young monk
sunlight on the bay

rainy day
in the rainforest
drip, drip, drip

the seasons change
she buys new
colour contacts

winter night
hot buttered rum
fog on glasses

grey sea and sky
she dreams of
blue irises

after the party
a lone woman drinks
a birthday gift

Wind howls and
the cedars sway --
drunken sailors

An ocean breeze
flips through empty pages --
haijin's notebook

long after
the witching hour
a candle flutters

the wolf howl lingers
fades into the night's
eerie silence

long cold snap --
the icicle
begins to fork

Pressed among pages
of old dictionary
a list of action verbs

one hundred views
of the sunrise -
appartment block

predawn
a grey dove outside
my window

solstice
a shaft of sunlight
through rock

rainburst--
thoughts of you
fading

straw hat -
flowers fading
under the sun

New sheets.
I remember
your hands.

shaking the stone from her shoe -
a white opal swings
from between her brown breasts

summer butterfly
a girl wearing a white dress
in the morning breeze

soft jazz
candle light and lip gloss
in the corner 

low clouds --
a gull circles above
the police car light

Earth Day...
slowly the anesthetic
takes effect

August 6--
my father does not say
good morning

cloudburst 
the last nail hammered 
in the rain

autumn chill
the mausoleum covered
with sparrows

autumn chill
the chalkboard screeches
at her touch 

signal station
a woodpecker taps
in the dusk

snow flurries :::
a blue jay's feather
clings to the yard 

snow glare
onion bulbs sprouting 
from the bag

geriatric ward--
the table groans
when they fold it up

sun dog--
so many names
carved on the cliff 

snowy banks --
the drifting duck leans
into a curve

Easter--
an anxious mother calls
in the wind

breathless --
camellias falling
one by one

starless night--
Las Vegas spills
over the desert

fragile morning--
a blue psilocybin in the middle
of the garden

dusk--
the space between us
filling with snow

spring wind --
the magnolia sweeps
the sky

night shift --
he tree frogs sing a road
through the forest

a dark horse
with a blue harness --.
winter solstice

cold spring --
burnt waffles
and raspberry jam

mid-summer --
the nighthawk cries between
Pittsburgh and heaven

a long split
in the black inky cap --
snow clouds

on the roof late --
my brother hammers nails
in the moon

home for Christmas
the fruitcake we always
pretended to like

autumn leaves
my fear
of falling 

cold moon
the sound of my words
in her eyes

the heat . . .
a silent fountain
drenched in moonlight

trick or treat
I promise the vampire
the dog won't bite

fireworks over . . .
the silence
of the stars

walking home
after the rainbow
a crescent moon

Omaha Beach
the sound of wave
after wave

Memorial Day
old enough to remember
a time between wars

dusk--
a yellow leaf passes
through the beaver dam

monsoon season raindrops dot the dust

Memorial Day
we try to remember
when the war began

drifting from dream to dream hazy moon

she tells me I missed
a beautiful sunrise
black no sugar

children's voices
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed

her obituary . . .
the things we did
that summer

a homeless man
rises from the sidewalk
Easter morning

snowmelt . . .
my neighbor and I forget
we're not speaking

brightening sky
after the eclipse
a skylark's song

steady rain
a little salt
in my beer

season's end --
the scent of fish
drifts downstream

crescent moon
the new home still full
of echoes

first pussy willow
I open my notebook
of unfinished poems

the curved back
of a garden Buddha
winter rain

year's end
the time it takes a contrail
to dissolve

deep in the woods
leaves drifting over
what used to be a wall 

autumn light
nobody I know
in the obits

autumn leaves
I follow
their drift

where the carpet
is wearing thin
autumn sunlight

as old as I feel
on a gray morning . . .
autumn equinox

evening calm
her garden the color
of moonlight

new coolness --
a cloud passes through
the mountain notch

awake
in the dark
the darkness

narrow path
I make way
for the butterfly

coming home . . .
the scent of the ocean
before the sound

Labor Day
a fly buzzing around
the leftovers

poor neighborhood
a dog barking at the end
of a rope

vacant lot
hardly worth
a haiku

steady rain
where the bookstore
used to be

class reunion
an old friend's glance
at my name tag 

Easter vigil
candle flames tremble
at our breath

just passing through . . .
a parking lot where I saw
Gone with the Wind

soft rain
fishing line parts
a cloud of gnats

train window
the landscape coming 
to a stop

almost spring
her pink scarf taken
by the wind

a furniture store
where the church used to be 
vernal equinox

midnight
the silence beyond
the streetlight

waving goodnight
after the party
the chill

the white coffin
she was buried in
this winter light

first snow
a walk through fallen leaves
to my childhood

harvest moon
the things I have left
undone

harvest moon
she tells him
she's late

downtown
pointing the way
with her cigarette

evening light
following the anchor line
into the sea

twelve years old
learning to pronounce
Hiroshima

an infant asleep
on her mother's lap . . .
this heat

the silence
around our words . . .
fireflies

winter moon
a tired old man
in the mirror

the laughter of children
running uphill . . ;
Gettysburg

waiting up
for their teenaged daughter . . .
distant fireworks

evening rain
she lets down
her hair

at the end
of a long afternoon
my faded shadow

awakened
by moonlight
an old regret

only the wind
off the ocean
Omaha Beach

how quickly
the nights grow longer --
fireweed in bloom

a few petals
left by the sweeper . . .
sunset clouds

locked out
I write a haiku
about daffodils

under a sky
of no particular color
dandelions

another spring
who will tell the dandelion
it's a weed

powdering the dog
a child asks if fleas
go to heaven

Valentine's Day
shaking the snow
from the roses

a toast
to the departing year -
snow turns to rain

after a storm
the absence
of a tree

waiting room
the steady hum 
of the fish tank

in the nursing home
she talks about the brother
no one talks about

winter temptation--
in the seed catalogues
perfect tomatoes

the evening train
almost empty --
sundogs

the morning sun
on grandma's grave
first butterfly

writer's block -
staring out the window
at snowflakes

Easter Sunday
the carefully trimmed beard
of the young priest

reading
the tea leaves . . . the gray
in her hair

the doctor wants
to take a closer look . . .
coffee gone cold

good news
from the cardiologist
autumn butterfly

dusting the books
I'll read when I have time
winter solstice

outside 
our bedroom window
falling sleet

dried leaves
hurry down the path
standard time

sleeping late
this autumn morning
the bed half empty

week of rain --
the henna tatoo
fading fast

crisp wind
the taste of the apple
just after picking it

on the beach
by the ancient city
sand castle ruins

rain
mixed with snow
spring equinox

Valentine's Day
we let the champagne
go flat

her head
bent over tea leaves . . .
how old she's grown

long winter
my wife slows her pace
to mine

undressing for bed
I find a hole in my sock -
the winter wind

returning spring
in the dawn light she looks like
my first love

morning prayer
the patter of rain
as I reach amen

teenagers
exchanging promises
summer's end

low tide --
a shorebird's call
rises from the mud

75 today
I walk through a puddle
because I can

her Alzheimer's
a dragonfly
goes . . . comes

last of his line
the year of his death
still uncarved

snow falling
on the headstones . . .
just and unjust wars 

petals in the wind
my neighbors practice tai-chi
in the parking lot

first firefly . . .
she asks me to repeat
what I just said

wrinkles in the bedsheet early dawn

first light . . .
after the car alarm
birdsong

second martini—
I like the way she asks me
if I twitter 

my first bite
of persimmon—
a trace of Shiki

Sunday drive --
all the rain clouds
toward home

Holy Week
she teaches her grandchild
to light a candle

another spring
I revise
my death poem

winter break
I hope I'll be home
for the crocuses

garden Buddha
morning rain washes away
the snow

the age
I used to call old . . .
winter solstice

quiet Sunday
a winter fly
too slow to kill

old photo
I recognize
my father's silence

hard times
the car salesman's
missing tooth

starry night
one firefly
after another

Assisi sunset
pilgrims gather
at a gift shop

summer salad --
a nasturtium burns
the tip of my tongue

city sunset
he buys her
a rose

red light
the bus driver reads
his horoscope

flag pin
in the salesman's lapel
Memorial Day

the soft patter
of a computer keyboard
midnight solitude

main street
a red pick-up cruises
the spring rain

traffic jam
a flight of geese
across the highway

first light
an unknown bird
sings me awake

spring equinox
opening our fortune cookies

darkened church
she teaches her grandchild
to light a candle

Ash Wednesday
this is the year
he'll quit

a spider web
caught in my hand;
scent of rain

thin crescent . . .
I wonder what
she meant by that

packing up the creche
one of the wise men
is missing

cold moon
a carriage horse trots
up Sixth

cold moon
the glitter of city lights 
in the river

thin crescent
she closes
the curtains

whistling kettle
snowflakes
in the wind

cold rain
lavender neon surrounds
a sex shop window

twentyfourseven
an empty laundromat
at dawn

overtime . . .
through an office window
the harvest moon

a night of fireflies
and cricket song . . .
the end of summer

a damp evening --
each of us with
our own cloud of gnats

rain on the lake
turning down
the volume

where do I
put the accent --
Hiroshima

brookside
whales are roaring
in a poem I read

sudden shower
cursing the umbrella
he left at home

outside the wall
around the cemetery
long grass

mother's day
something sexy
for his wife

war news
I wash the ink
from my fingers

rainy night
a light in
the bookstore window

wiping his eyes 
before the lights come up-
sad movie

winter sunset
shadows of branches
climb the fire escape

wildfire haze
between the icebergs --
the blue wind

January walk
Santa Claus and a flag
in a neighbor's window

my friend's ashes
heavier than I expected
winter wind

home for a visit
the sound of rain
on the river

low mass
the old priest believes
more than he remembers

new year's party
the divorced couple
leaves together

undulation
of a faded flag
autumn afternoon

midwinter
the coffee drinker
sips tea

morning rush
reading Walden
on the subway

election day
revising the poem
one more time

fog moving in
another phone call
unreturned

dandelions --
I lose sight of
the yellow butterfly

summer rain
my umbrella
stays closed

early summer
old women in the shade
of the bus shelter

a boy and his dad
playing catch out back . . .
long shadows

main street-
ribbons that used to be
yellow

terminal . . . 
his favorite ice cream 
melts in the cup

spring morning
those young men have noticed 
what she's not wearing

old western --
black hats white hats 
in shades of gray

spring rain
a man standing outside
the bus shelter

snowflakes
a robin's flight
from tree to tree

serving coffee
she asks if I take cream
the curve of her wrist

someone whistling
Blue Moon at the falls --
the mist

waiting for you
at the sidewalk cafe
half moon

chemotherapy-
she always liked the way
I kissed her hair

undulation
of a faded flag-
autumn afternoon

streetlight
my shadow growing
fading

rainy day--
they give me back
my shoelaces

storm clouds -
the roofer talks about
overtime

nearly eighty -
opening
a jar of preserves

long after
the funeral service
- the unspoken words

dusk-
an unfinished sweater
on the rocking chair

sleepless night -
the whistle of a distant train
going  where ?

Minnesota cold
even motorcycles
hibernate

lenghtening days --
a bird's shadow crosses
the yellow wall

last straw rejection --
the telemarketer tells me
I'm too old

a gloomy sunday
I sip my wine
and watch the rain
once on such a day
it was the time for love

poetry meeting
I try to read my haiku...
a frog in my throat

here and there
breaking through the dusk's mist
bright lights

voices of loons
cross the misted cove
call and response

A red berry falls
Staining the snow --
A silent sunset.

This dark night;
Only white spots move
On the calico cat.

spring thaw
water from the fridge drips
onto the floor

Post Office --
stamped on the sidewalk
pink blossoms

wooden Buddha
with a cracked head on display
no buyers

new moon --
lamplight fills the holes
in a shot-out sign

a new month - 
different seeds 
on the spaniel's ears 

ah ces nuits courtes
à peine le temps de voir
les graines monter

dernier jour de l'année
une feuille au vent sur une très longue
tige

toute une procession
ces funérailles du trente et un
décembre 2004

flocon de neige
sans une parole, la femme
bâillonnée

l'imprimante crache
le phénix millénaire--
une autre feuille

iris bleu
elle regarde l'aiguille
pénétrer sa chair

hibiscus
under the eaves
frost burned petals

the fish lazily surface
in the pond nearby ~
the sun on my teacup

dream catcher
the shifting colours
of rain

moss growing
on the manhole cover --
winter rain

wild wind
on dry sedge--
what more on her mind? 

oak stump-
i remember the hornets
last summer

apple core
how to bottle
memories

though touch-less
the intimate rustle of silk 

first dawn alone-
the widow eats his half
of the orange

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

lunar eclipse-
his eyes on her frayed
jeans front 

petal gust-
the street flutist's
scrambled notes 

blue dawn?
the rain's last phrase
on a glass pane

red lobster-
her prying glance
through the mist

news of his death --
I can't stop looking
at the sickle moon

mixing bowls-
the shallow echoes
of bells 

winter solstice
the widow tightens
her braids

candle drippings
on the epitaph-
a broken word

granite wall
a cold touch so hard
to resist

mountain wind
the echo of a cuckoo's
cough louder

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

plop
the sound of bubble
from a carp

pine strand
flailing in night sky-
the first low star

twilight rain
the blue heron mid-lake
somehow smaller

overcast
an orange scarf flails
on the clothesline

daybreak -
ice between
the river stones

opaque windows 
barring the dawn 
of the new year

even seagulls 
imitate the stones 
first frost

the sound of foam
withdrawing from the shore
our unsaid goodbyes

winter trees
waiting on the silence
our breaths

full moon
he smoothens a wrinkle
on her hand

somehow
our shrinking shadows touch
harvest moon

words
we've left unsaid-
Indian summer

crocus buds--
secrets we've kept
from each other
(bourgeons de crocus--
les secrets que nous avons gardés
l'un pour l'autre) 

cherry blossoms
shedding in the moonlight--
the Milky Way

winter sky--
the white cat's eyes
bluer--

locking it -
moonlight at the back
of the mailbox

the coming of summer-
all the petals
i brushed off my hair

gray spring dawn-
the shiver of daffodils
in my bones

this cold-
Sakura cherry blossoms
on my window

this sunless spring day
chickadees chatter on-
my indecisions

watching rain
drum beat on window pane--
the deaf cat

spring fever--
shoots among the lilies
she can't name

mirror-
she sees her flaws
in his eyes

mirror
her mother's lips
pursing like hers

between her
and his goodbye-
sudden hail

from haiku scribblings
to a prayer
on a giant wave

silence -
the evening snow falls
onto moss

secrets--
burrowing in sand dunes
a pale sunlight

left out in the rain
her old haiku
on cherry blossoms

late winter walk-
soft rain on bare cherry trees
harder on my thoughts

in the mist
waiting to meet you-
budding crocus

frosted dawn-
his words hang
over coffee

deep winter--
nothing much to say
even among crows

on street -
a shower of petals
for no one

first frost--
the last of the roses
have lost their names

girl in Sunday dress
in her father's shadow--
lost too soon

day after Christmas-
crows waddling to bus stop
no one awaits

distant thunder-
a caterpillar drops
from a ragged leaf

blizzard-
the slanting lines, piercing lines
our locked hands 

first frost--
the chapel two hours darker
for vespers

white sun
burning through November sky
her nth unanswered call

turning
one leaf at a time-
entries for memorials 

autumn sunset
breaches rain-swept horizon-
as embers sizzle

picking autumn leaves
off the grass, her grave
nothing but fine rain

pomegranate seeds
bursting in their hands
613 haiku

on an evening trail
of red dragonflies swarming
in a pool, stars 

leaves crackling-
in her grave tiny hands sweep
leavings of sparrows 

swarm of tiny wings
fades out in the autumn sky-
unfinished journal 

first light
the perfect symmetry
of a moth

white moonlight
seeps into my sadness-
into a mulch bed

grey skies grey thoughts
so clear as reflections
on rain puddles

maple twig
turns lemon hue in the rain-
i reply to summer mail

folding beach mats
the whiff of fresh grilled corn
this chilly morning

dawn by the river-
we breach a wall of sand
the cry of a loon

crow browsing grass
steps on camellia blossom-
fractured silence

cloudy day--
my thoughts stuck
on a spider web

concentration camp
winter branches touch
the statue's shoulders

stripping off
her sweatshirt ~
sparks in the dark

valentine's day
only rain
on the scarecrow

noon --
the morning clouds
roll from the valley

aged painter ~
trembling leaves
from the tip of his brush

tailgating trucker
is that load bound for K-Mart
worth more than my life?

This road
no one goes down it
autumn evening

Natural rhythms
moons and tides supplanted by
yellow red and green

Seven miles per gallon
Bush thanks you for 
supporting the Iraq war

My Ford Explorer
on a never-ending quest
for a parking spot

Cochrane Alberta 
Coyotes howling in the night 
Honking, geese at dawn 

Like Custer's bugler,
you sound the charge. Remember
the Little Big Horn.

I-5 corridor
Microsofties creep to work
slowly, in nice cars

If you really love
America hang that flag 
on a bicycle

invasive species
my barber points out
my first white hairs

slowly ...
a loon preens
in the mountains reflection

Atlanta traffic
easy to see why Sherman
burned this city down

a hundred streets named
peachtree - no wonder sherman
burned this city down

I saw that finger!
yes you in the Intrepid -
we shall meet again

he's a stop and go
christopher columbus in
your ford explorer

brooklyn bridge walkway
bombsquad found a stray backpack 
homeland traffic jam

keep an eye open
for food, gas and ten-year-old - 
an amber alert!

the mailbox
captive in snowdrift
a letter from war

late afternoon –
a wind chime softly sings
in snowy garden

autumn bonfire –
all my summer dreams
scatter with the smoke

growing darkness
gleam of setting sun
on Chinese Lantern

waiting...
dandelion fluff
lands on the table

the winter sun 
in the cancer ward -
a quiet old couple

old pond -
another lily
in bloom

One just sits;
And blue dawn light floods
his poor house.

Soprano, clear and cool,
and pale violin float;
Above the freeway noise.

chemo patient
seeking inspiration
in a bookstore

November -- 
her nipple ring cools

pumpkin moon:
tai chi movements time
the eclipse photos

frost
on the pumpkin:
lunar eclipse

earthquake
with the typhoon -- more coins
at the temple

Memorial Day --
a shadow for each
white cross

a twilight sun
between two peaks -
white lilacs

spring moonset --
a rice ball for
breakfast

in the grasses
crickets calling
the full moon

Eating alone --
The sound of cold milk
Into a glass.

in my rear view mirror
the moon
on full beam

hard frost
wrapping myself up against
the breakfast news

winter bleak
under the rail bridge
graffiti blooms

left padlocked
under streetlight
orion's bike 

past the pleiades the silent flight of many white birds

christmas lights . . .
high above the street a skein
of twilight geese

in the walled garden
the scent
of decaying apples

boardwalking--
the dragonfly's shadow
drops through a crack

another day
another apple crumble
. . . autumn deepens 

Heavy the heads of darkened sunflowers, I wonder, how long do I have

autumn days
the weight of my life's
unpicked apples

hindsight
a field of
cut stalks

tree burl
summer reveals
my old scars

our shadows
leaning on the railings
on the pond

wind chime
my phone picks up
a wifi hotspot

fallen apples
the constellation of
the gardener

double espresso, the wail of sirens on a sultry night

i wait for the weather forecast, wiping sunflower pollen from the windowsill

water lilys
a leaping fish
catches the light

in the depths
of her sunglasses
blue sky  some
passing clouds

leaning over the fence our late neighbour's rose

solstice day
park grass pale
where the fairground
rides had been

two swans
the progress
of twilight
along the river

forget-me-nots
our white dog shakes off
pale blue stars 

remembering you
cold and warm
on the same breeze

day break
half a pale blue
egg shell 

good friday
the outstretched arms
of the espalier pear

how high into
the hillside cemetery
the fog tide rolls 

Holes in the cloud. A shade of blue I've never seen

flashing against
the winter killed grass
a swan's whiteness

Exposed roots.
The tree outside her
childhood home

Punctuation.
A rose petal falls
from the vase

One week later
fewer roses in
a slenderer vase

no bag we wrap the leeks in the obituary page

all the suns
that we can muster
winter celandine

unsuspected metastasis moss on the roof tiles

hard frost all the new benches graffiti-tagged in silver

work done
my shadow reaches
the sunlit laurels

faltering resolutions the roof gutters still full of last year's leaves

the window cleaner's ladder
leaves two small holes
in the planet

April -
a gull's cry passing
through morning snow

rattling white in my eye socket a half moon and two aspirin 

Oh, a cold rain
again fills the river
with circles

Moss on the roof
tiles. First one cat
then another

i go to bed you stay downstairs
the windscreens ice over

year's end
there's a hearse
in the fast lane

geminids a couple
of white pills before
i go to bed

double whisky
everything glistens
in the mist

overcast
until a white moth lands
on my phone screen

wind chime
a text brings news
of his death

frost burn
high windows blaze
with sunlight

spring evening
a long pause on the bridge
to watch the water run

glistening frost
the slow blue arc
of a buzzard

roadkill pheasant
all the blustery colours
of autumn

in the hedge
the lighted windows
of a train

in dark river water, shapes of things from the human world

somewhere beyond our chilli pepper plant the red dragonfly's home

even after 30 years
the scent of honeysuckle
one summer night

into the space between thoughts falling rose petals

monday morning
ant traffic on the main stem
of the rose

full moon
a pear hanging
this side of the wall

starless night
the cyclist
without lights

sunny afternoon
the scent of leaf mold
mixed in the ice

hawk, on a fence post.
first light,
the rain a kind of mist.

day moon
the jellyfish we spot
from the end of the pier

muggy night opening another window to let in more insects

sunglassesheadphones  the world beyond

a blue-black feather glistens with rain another unexplained bruise

high summer
where the shade stops
so does the dog

grey skies our late neighbour's pink roses reach over the fence

not long till sundown
into the willows
a yellow frisb e e 

sunlight in the snail trails my glittering career

another cloudy night
i google
the moon phase

water changing
into ice --
the pale moon

sunless days
the world locked in
a pine cone

easter sunset
a red-tinged cross
of contrails

neatly stacked
the scents
of sawn timber

plum blossom
the haiku poet's mind . . .
elsewhere

spring sunshine
on a high branch a plastic bag
puffs out its chest

in the grey of relentless rain 
his shaved cranium and huge red headphones

on the brickwork graffiti, and marks that say ivy was here

new moon i hear about it first via twitter

red tulips in the vase on TV another cosy murder show

winter solstice
inside the hollow tree
fire blackened

Zen garden
after each storm
a clean slate

hazy afternoon
the woodpecker's call
bounces off the ice

her skin flickers in television light rain on the window

the proper word for brackets escapes me crescent moon

a cut glass bowl
holds the shells of our summers
this life in exile

hard frost -
deep in my coat pocket
summer sea-glass

that same music
again and again
winter rain

the graveyard
our icy shortcut
through the winter fog

icebleak
no colour but the rail bridge
graffiti

still life -
at the lake's edge a tree's reflection
caught in the ice

november sun -
leaning on the old stone wall
a shadow tree

winter solstice
the pink tongue of a cat
lapping at snowmelt

dusky clouds --
a patch of blue
hangs over the valley

demi-lune
la glace craque
sous les pas

war memorial
snow has almost covered
the poppy wreaths

antique store window
looking at dirty street snow
through colored bottles

cold attic -
faded cigar box
filled with seashells

windless day
the prolific weeds
at the grave site

mushiatsui asa
te ga kimi o
omoidashi

taifuu ya
sugi tatta ba ni
hikari ari

ame no yoru
niwa no iwa ni wa
mizu no oto

egret stands
in the blue rice field,
dusk creeps in

long centipede
on the ceiling- long talks
of what to do

February --
the heart-shaped tracks
of a moose

white clouds drift
in the August sky,
a child dreams

tan lines
and coconut oil
high tide

restless night
the morning starts
without me

familiar names-
the warmth of a woodstove
in January

fine shell new moon
onto cherry pink horizon...
shades of easter egg

A lull in the storm --
the woodpecker darts
to another tree.

The thyme
has gone to seed --
summer's end.

things come and go 
raindrops
on the pine

my stone Buddha
sits in the dark 
snow, snow, snow

cherry petals
flying higher and higher -
storm in my valley

returning birds --
three notes pass through
morning fog

a cup of tea
and a koan to go -
my cold morning

severe frost -
the sparkling whiteness
of my brown roof

autumn deepens -
I wonder what my neighbour
is writing today ?!

voices of autumn -
the patter of raindrops
on my rooftiles

first cicada -
the hot day seems
even hotter

red poppy dolls
sit alone by the beach -
dead children of Tohoku 

politicians play
the same old games -
long rainy season
les politiciens jouent
les mêmes vieux jeux -
longue saison pluvieuse 

late spring -
the old kettle
still shines

earthquake night -
the stars are as silent
as ever

table 4 2
- a romance reduced
to numbers

scent of rain
all the ways
we failed each other

cold sunshine -
the icicles refuse
to melt

cold night -
the deeper levels of dreams
and fears

when celsius
and farenheit meet -
cold night

New Year's morning -
I wipe some dirt
from my glasses

blizzard -
the heavy weight
of snowflakes

menopause -
she even quarrels with
the autumn moon

tookei ya tsuwamonodomo no yume wa ima

fighting
the summer heat -
no time for poetry

the future
deep in the tea leaves ...
spring growth

first firefly -
the moon also shows
his face

spring rain
the dogwood
half petals, half leaves

wisteria blossoms . . .
the faint memories
of grandmother's lace 

daybreak - - 
light and shadow 
on the apricot blossoms

how black !
dirt on the last patch
of snow

rainy day -
I finally finished
the Spring Saijiki

computer crash ...
I wish I were
this butterfly

my daily bread
on the empty table ...
spring equinox

old plum tree in bossom ...
last year the old owner
died

moonlight
on the temple roof -
and silence

autumn equinox -
all the crows celebrating
with grave offerings

the dance of
echoes inside a crypt . . .
winter chill

hunger moon
how bittersweet
this longing

dinner outside ...
the crumbs walk along
the brick wall

a tiny world
unfolds and thrives -
summer rain

the backyard
of a poor man's home ...
summer heat

more rain -
lavender leans
on the stone Buddha

no fireflies ...
moonlight reflects
on camellia leaves

first firefly ...
a quiet night and then
lightning

powlonia blossoms -
a haiku floating
in the sky

a centipede
takes its morning walk ...
aah, my kitchen table

winter,s end ...
my warm socks
with big holes

spring sunshine
on the cat's belly ...
mountain hermitage

a fallen leaf
brushes the corner
of your grave stone

late snow ..
a pheasant calls
in the morning mist

Ides of March ...
anyone remembers
the history teacher?

spring blossoms ...
the old farmer
coughs blood

winter sunset -
half of my Buddha
still in the light

remembering you -
the sparkle of the last
icicle

first sunrise -
a fallen camellia
shines on my path

winter sunshine -
the slow growth of a stone's
shadow

autumn equinox ...
the murmur of waves
slowly changes

high autumn sky ...
in the world of men
voices of insects

autumn deepens ...
these tiny pink flowers
on my wildest weeds

autumn chill
the fallen leaf's veins
tinged a deeper hue

in the shade
of the full moon ...
distant fireworks

summer heat ...
the cats sleep
on the barbeque

looking for fireflies ...
I almost miss
the dramatic night sky

meditating
on a rainy day ...
new green tea

morning prayers -
the graves of the ancestors
in deep silence

day moon 
the clock has stopped
ticking

autumn evening -
the lingering warmth
of this old deck chair

autumn colors 
I remember mother's
favorite quilt

summer's end -
my cat still high
on the hot tin roof

autumn with alzheimer -
she breaks the bread
.. ... .. carefully

another day
the stilled heartbeat
on the ultrasound
(un autre jour
le battement de coeur calmé
à l'échographie) 

globalization -
he serves the sushi fish
on french bread

lightning
far away in the sky -
first firefly

summer in the temple -
the horns of the dragon
just visible

may rain 
ever more sparkling
shades of green

Confucius 
another long path
to the old pond

late spring -
the old kettle
still shines

war in Iraq -
a spider hides
in the cherry blossom

blue mountains -
the old tombstone
keeps watch

kyoofuu ni daite o-kure-yo ume shiroshi

spring storm -
the tall pine leans
toward the short

cheap motel
the desk clerk
turns a blind eye

day lilies
the dormant spark of death
within me

rosebuds in snow -
the softness of his hand
on my shoulder

hitokoto mo iwanu warera ya tera no aki

spring storm 
the wind rings our
visitor's bell

mandarin ducks -
a silent pair on
the dinner table

winter in town --
the stone memorial of the
God of Water

winter morning 
a few dewdrops on
my last rose

winter sunshine -
the many shadows of
a small camellia

wedding anniversary  
does he still love me
like the red winter berries ?

cold winter day -
hot tea from Kenya
in my cup

vernal equinox
my days and nights now measured
not in hours
but by our time together
and apart

mountain temple -
a prayer overgrown
with moss

autumn deepens  
a last sunray
on the pines

misty morning -
a black and white world
behind the graves

doing the dishes -
a tiny soap bubble rises
toward heaven

summer sunset 
your hand heavy
on my knee

kyoo mo mata
ochiba ni yuki no
yamagurashi

snow on red leaves 
so many coincidences
in my life

the dragon 
now a cloud
in my sky

listening
to an incense stick 
autumn draws deeper

autumn deepens 
memories fade into
misty clouds

despite
the foreclosure sign
daffodills

autumn deepens 
the crows chatter muffled
by thick fog

just staring
at some autumn clouds 
a hot cup of tea

mata hitotsu
kabe ni ana ari
ten takashi

miya suzushi
baba wa kami o
katari-ori

lunchtime 
a dead cicada
surrounded by ants

enlightenment stones
in the temple garden
summer heat

fragrant daphne 
the money collector stops
before he knocks

hailstorm 
under the groaning roof
I hold my breath

white roads
leading nowhere 
Happy New Year ?

an old temple
amongst cedar trees
too many leaves fallen...

freezing rain
the words
I cannot take back

forgetting my words
step by step
the autumn night deepens

a mosquito
aiming noisily 
the sound of one hand

ooame ya
tobimawaru wa
shiroki cho

watching summer clouds
thoughts shaping and
reshaping

kiri saite
suterare mura ni
haka nokoru

haru no ame
mukashi mukashi no
monogatari

after the postman --
nothing in the mailbox
except a lizard

November afternoon
the insistent bell
of an ice cream vendor

breakfast alone--
I find the dove's feather
he left for me

late frost
warmth of the tea mug
against my cheek

deep winter
igniting the match
with a lit candle

library return
her hand's warmth
lingers in the book

cloudless sky
the gleam of fresh lemons
in a blue bowl

from a mirror
pale blue eyes stare knowingly
the snow will deepen

prairie roads
in ditches full of snowmelt
moons float

old house,
all doors
are open

a kitten...
will it too forget
its first snow?

full moon night...
starting the camp fire
with a page of fashion magazine

a new cellphone...
so many people to talk to
till the battery dies

out of the city,
so many stars
unnamed

late summer rain --
two kids break the bottles
under the bridge

cold rain
the persistent warmth
of your kiss

acorn falls
the sound of rain
continues

the moon
in every puddle
the same

Falling leaves
I already miss you
This winter

raking the leaves ~
wind blows
the wrong way

hot beach sand...
between my fingers
a cigarette butt

between the second
and the third line -
short trip to bathroom

stupid arab -
he only wants to learn
to fly straight

dentist's office -
cracks between tiles
filled with dirt

after a cold night
a cup of coffee -
oh, man!

Xmas away from home -
B-52 pilot
dressed as Santa

Thanksgiving
a new seat
at the table

hedgehog in the fog
looking for apples
under the wrong tree

van gogh's blue irises
hangs on a wall, with
other gardens

storm clouds -
mother searches for
candles

lavender blooms
next to the violets
in a blue pot

Purple nights
fold into morning
whiteouts,
your silence frosts
my first cup of coffee.

through closed eyelids
lightning strikes
my dream

stars
a full pool
in the garden

trempés
dans le vieux marc
on se câline --

fresh sawdust
among the birches --
his bent shoulders

discarding
the tea leaves--
distant thunder

autumn wind
knowing what you
will say next

scent of roses --
counting the stars
one by one

thunderstorm --
a shadow pauses
at the gate

starry night. . .
counting out my pills
for chemo

of many circles

terminal cancer 
the contrails end 
midair 

Un trou dans le mur
les mésanges emménagent
chez le rouge-queue

pale sunrise
outside the quiet house
yellow rose blooms

winter sunlight
on rumpled linen
those slow hands

open jalousies
night blooming jasmine
and stars

jasmine
beneath the stars
his blue eyes

wine sapped moon
the distance beyond
her lover's wife 

ferocious storms
wakened by the wet
of a dog tongue

winter sun
the slow drip-drip
of an icicle

starry night
a million words
unspoken

the last of the boxes
finally moved out
cloud covered sunset

from my window
a maple's lichened trunk
the only green

handing off the keys
a chill wind hustles
the end of April

all the birds
unnamed on the fence
spring rain

sleepless night
same old song
over and over

labor day
and still
no labor

open jalousies
the missing scent
of his cologne 

wine moon
the heat in the kitchen
so close

sunny afternoon
sand swept
behind the door

middle of the night
on a wicked wind
passing news

morning stillness
a bird song
I've never heard before

sunday sermon
children's voices 
mix with the choir

starless night
my daughter delivered home
by a policeman

Mother's Day
everytime
she calls

heavy rain
a darkening sky
behind her face

Sunday afternoon
bittersweet chocolate
and swapped addresses

Sunday dusk
a last wine bottle
piled in the trunk

Boston news
a crazy day and yet
that butterfly

dockside fight
french fries in a pile
of seagulls

habemus papam!
I've always loved
Latino men

internet break
the smell of rain
and boggy earth

past midnight
public television
lights up the room

warm drizzle
cinnamon buns
and tea for two

Valentine's Day
thin ice covers
the pond

distant thunder
a whiff of
foreign perfume

autumn morning
dew-drops dripping
from a cane pole

autumn sun
hidden in the flower bed
mushrooms

Indian summer
the baby in the back seat
mine for a week

waning moon
my parents visit
comes to an end

morning mist
his wallet and keys
missing again

making a u-turn
clear in the rear view mirror
autumn afternoon 

graveside service
slipping from Grandma's book
pressed wildflowers

middle of the night
my fingers tick tick ticking
a hot flash haiku

hot, humid day
a jazz station plays
cool tunes 

biting the peel
a burst of orange mist
firelight 

night watch
the ex boyfriends house
on google earth

autumn wind
another  leaf flutters
from the pile

standing alone
under a double
rainbow

summer rain
the missing scent
of cologne

summer twilight
push mowers stop
for crickets

the same moon
shines on us both --
these cold sheets

last leaves
shaking on a branch
late migrators

spring cleaning --
a family of raccoons
empties the goldfish pond

campfire embers
one firefly
lights our tent

twilight
in the Chinese lantern
a glowworm

first snow
all the shades
of white

sleepless night
a square of moonlight
crosses the room

foggy glasses . . .
   a blurry paragraph
       above the bath water

new year's day . . .
     spent bottle-rockets
           in the road

wolf prints . . .
  the gas lantern
     splutters

novocain prick--
the warmth where
the dental nurse leans

the smell
of many campfires
in this old hunting shirt

cinco de mayo
horses roll
in the shallows

 vanishing difference . . .
   gliding geese settle onto
        their reflections

folding chair
the newborn colt tries
to stand

damp straw . . .
   the day-old colt mesmerized
       by the radio

solstice
sipping a stronger brew
in the waning light

prying
   at the window . . .
       wind

silhouette. . .
  a shining snow path to
     a pale moon

hillside thunder
barely a rainbow in a plume
of smoke

morning camp
only an ember remains
but it's enough

storm warnings . . .
sunday afternoon by the fire
mail from an old friend

leftover summer grass
... horses browse
through crusted snow

old leather saddle
cherry colored and shiny
smells of horse

giorno di vento
sui muri del paese
ombre di foglie

sei andata via
e la giornata sembra
farsi più fredda

notte inoltrata
in silenzio il silenzio
si fa più buio

year-end bank statement
reusing the tea bag
for a second cup

il cielo e io
in silenzio scambiamo
pensieri e stelle

la casa vuota
i mobili soltanto
ad aspettare

la casa vuota
la riempie il suono
della pioggia

sulla parete
nella striscia di luce
l'ombra d'un volo
on the wall
in the light stripe
the shadow of a flight

giunge la sera
il volo d'un gabbiano
solca il silenzio

siepe d'alloro
sommersa dai rifiuti
gloria in degrado

dai miei sogni
nel cuore della notte
giungono voci

notte romana
bloccata in un ingorgo
sotto la luna

grandine e pioggia
una crosta di gelo
soffoca i campi

sveglia la notte
un sasso nello stagno
spruzzi di luna

desert landscape
rain will come and the water...
remembers each path

winter night
the chill of moonlight
on my skin

notte di pioggia
fa compagnia il suo suono
all'ammalato

fine del giorno
dal fioraio invenduti
i crisantemi

la casa vuota
apre e chiude le imposte
giorno di vento

festa finita
dalle candele spente
sale il fumo

night watch
in the sheperds eyes
a flock of stars

anche sui fiori 
dopo il funerale
cala
il buio

la prima neve
racchiusa tra i petali
del crisantemo

la casa vuota
la pioggia ha cancellato
tutte le impronte

il posto vuoto
rende più buio il buio
notte d'autunno

colpo di vento
fermato sopra il muro
da un pennello

rain turns to sleet
grounding my daughter
our shared tears 

Sera di pioggia
montagne in dissolvenza
grigio su grigio

la vecchia agenda
chiusa in un cerchio rosso
la mia nascita

nella coppella
scavata nella roccia
galleggia un grillo

giorno di sole
sulla facciata sale
l'ombra del fumo

un nuovo anno
in giardino la neve
ancora intatta

cade la neve
sul ramo i passerotti
sempre più stretti

nel manicomio
sopra il giaciglio vuoto
graffio di luna

cambio di casa
sulle pareti tracce
ma non la storia

cielo di nubi
la guglia della chiesa
così immobile

corre la notte
su ali di falena
verso la luce

winter in the wind
no cake for this candle lit
in memoriam

palma tagliata
sono rimaste solo
poche lucciole

sul calendario
segnano i cerchi rossi
il mio percorso

menti perdute
nella loro memoria
alberi nudi

legno d'olivo
il percorso dell'olio
nelle sue vene

caffè tostato
il profumo ha svegliato
tutta la strada

villa romana
spalanca la sua porta
sopra il vuoto

tempio di Vesta
sopra il suo fuoco spento
cade la pioggia

primo mattino
qualche fiocco di neve
sul basilico

città di notte
profumano la pioggia
le caldarroste

cielo sereno
la corrente del fiume
trascina stelle

all saints day
from the corner of my eye
someone no one

luna a metà
a metà il libro aperto
sul tavolino

tra mozziconi
e macchine in parcheggio
un fiore giallo

tra le magnolie
la Folia di Corelli 
in un violino

grano maturo -
i miei capelli sono
foglie d'autunno
ripe corn -
my hair is
Autumn leaves
grain mûr -
mes cheveux sont
des feuilles d'automne 

luna tagliata
ogni mese il tuo seno
ricostruito

nel crepuscolo
due seggiole in colloquio
anche se vuote

neve leggera - 
il martello di un picchio
nel silenzio

all'aereoporto
qualcuno ha cancellato
i passeggeri

primo dell'anno
l'ombra del calicantus
sul calendario

al cimitero
aumentano ogni anno
le mie fermate

cold rain
a maple leaf floats
in the water basin

il nido vuoto
l'ha riempito l'erba
della grondaia

parete etrusca
dipinta dal passaggio
di una lumaca

notte di luna
l'ombra di un pesco in fiore
sopra il muro

sul marciapiede
bagnato dalla pioggia
cammino in cielo

collana rotta
in ogni perla sparsa
un po’ di cielo

sera di Giugno
dalla porta socchiusa
soltanto buio

giardino chiuso
passa il muro il profumo
degli aranci

ansa del fiume
dove affogò la bimba
papiri in fiore

sul marciapiede
in mezzo ai ciclamini
un uomo solo

notte di Pasqua
la madre siede accanto
al letto vuoto

deep autumn
we read love poems once
in these woods

dopo la pioggia
la tomba del bambino
riflette il cielo

sul marciapiede
una scritta d'amore
e tanti passi

crescent moon
a new path
to scatter seeds

notte di vento
guarda il malato le
ultime foglie

leoni egizi
nella luce d'autunno
guardano il sole

casa deserta
si affaccia alla finestra
la luna piena

spezza i pensieri
la punta del cipresso
scossa dal vento

margherite nel
vaso accanto al pane
caldo di forno

sulla collina
rovine d'un castello
e meli in fiore

dopo la pioggia
la luna quasi piena
perde colore

October moon
white pumpkins glow
in the field

cade la pioggia
l'acquedotto romano
ritrova l'acqua

all'improvviso
un pianoforte mentre
sorge la luna

pietre tombali
strette le une alle altre
vento d'autunno

il tempo passa
le tombe al cimitero
si fanno vecchie

mown field
long lines of stems
nameless

scala di pietra
sui gradini le impronte
d'uomini e pioggia

in mezzo al mirto
scolpita nel granito 
porta sul nulla

il vento porta
profumo di mimosa
tra le antenne

da un anno all'altro
invecchia con il tronco
il cuore inciso

Cerveteri: necropoli etrusca.
Cerveteri: Etruscan necropolis.

autumn arrives early
for this mountain ridge
and me

stasera anche
la neve in gondola
sul Canal Grande

manto di neve -
è mascherato anche
il mendicante

macchie di rosso...
soltanto papaveri
nell'erba verde

nel crepuscolo
voli di cormorani
e sciacquio d'onde

sulla collina
gregge di case sparse
senza pastore

barbone morto
passaggio di stagione
tra i rifiuti

 lampi d'estate
svelano nella notte
le vie nascoste

Strada nebbiosa
dopo l'angolo trovo
un muro chiuso

Country cemetery
snail on corroded tombstone
trails from A to O...

Ancient roman ruins
along both sides of the road
white jet trail above...

autumn mist
bull elk's mating call
splits the silence

Sky dewed with stars
cool air listening in news
a man was hanged.

sundown
summer evening melts in dark
fragrance of tea~

misty summer rain
calling pheasant
in Zen temple

a wild violet
on the sunny hill~
noon time nap

Spring equinox
Pray the ancestor grave
In cold rain

kirinoyoni amaikaorino shirokiume

autumn rain --
refinery lights remind me
of Christmas

topless,
the skyscraper
in rain mist

fading light -
the stone steps brighter
than the foliage

raining--
last night's baked chicken
tonight's curried soup

first frost
instead of silk
flannel

monsoon-
on the window a leech climbs
the himalayas

matin blanc
loin là-bas des hôpitaux
bombardés 

doucement la lame
sous la chair de la mangue
soleil couchant 

froidure hivernale
personne sur le chemin
qui mène à la mare 

premières gelées
dans son pot le brin de menthe
refait ses racines 

nuit d'Épiphanie
ce rêve étrange envolé
aux premières lueurs 

lumière du soir
les serviettes sur la corde
remouillent 

retour de balade
lentement le ciel et les eaux
se confondent 

nuit pleine
dans le couloir mes pas
guidés par la lune 

bientôt minuit
le Père Noël en plastique
se dégonfle 

heavy rain--
the old rubber boots
not tall enough

autumn equinox
the fallen leaf
half-green, half-gold

premières éoliennes
lentement elles évacuent
un reste de nuit 

marché de Noël
de la choucroute alsacienne
sur le stand breton 

encore l'averse
dans le châtaignier trois geais
éclairent le jour 

nuit blanche
je rassemble les pétales
des roses fanées 

jour de Toussaint
de ma fenêtre
les eaux dormantes

temps des étrennes
près du vieil ordinateur
une souris neuve 

poches vides
le regard tendu vers la lune
presque pleine 

toute la nuit
la pluie sur la vitre
des moutons plein la tête 

lune montante
son ventre lisse
comme un galet 

dans la brume
le cou d'une oie
heure d'hiver 

morning tea
returning the cup
its emptiness

Toussaint
le cercle de famille s'élargit
sous le marbre 

risque de fusion -
sur mes doigts l'odeur
des immortelles de mer 

terre crue
de terrasse en terrasse
l'appel du muezzin 

temps d'orage -
sous les bottes le bruit
des pavés 

ciel bas
on scie des branches
quelque part 

miroitements
l'épouvantail agite
ses CD 

Pentecôte
la flamme
dans ses yeux 

carrefour 
sous le Christ en croix 
orties pourpres 

jours plus courts 
elle recouvre son visage 
de crème antirides 

Saint-Valentin
les oiseaux jasent
depuis huit jours 

autumn grasses
at least the tea
remains green

St Valentin
la cuisse du Bergerac
sur la langue 

sous le voile d'hivernage
la coccinelle
recroquevillée 

Premier de l'An
la fillette a mis trois soleils
dans son ciel 

premier jour de l'an
entre fromage et café
refaire le monde 

haïku faisant
incision
indolore 

la falaise
entaille la brume
jour sans vent 

nuit de décembre
planter un clou pour fixer
l'étoile 

premiers froids
un haïku d'été
au fond de la poche 

Chemin des Dames
le brouillard
n'efface rien 

pleine nuit
l'araignée recroquevillée
au coin de la marche 

this steady rain
the one thing I needed
you couldn't do:
to love me
without stint

soirée vin nouveau
le vent souffle plus fort
au retour 

nuit profonde
dans un rai de lune
le papillon fou 

midi
l'oeillet des dunes sent
plus fort

sortie des mariés 
les pétales de rose 
déjà fânés 

cornes fragiles
du gracile escargot
premières laitues

douceur printanière
les oies sauvages se regroupent
sans bruit

agadirs
femmes vêtues de sombre 
silence de plomb 

noces de laine
les premières mites
dans l'armoire

meteor watching --
a match lights up
an unknown face

snestormen -- 
alle vejskiltene
er hvide

end of summer
more cucumbers
than neighbors

som elevatoren synker...
at se i hendes øjnene

den draebte Talebankriger --
hans lilletaeer boejede
som mine

Idet den letter,
rør skarvens vinger vandet
seksten gange.

beginning of winter
the snow piled high
on the lawn chairs

graded papers
suddenly the rosebush
blooming

void encroaches
as vision vanishes:
glaucoma wins

homeless shelter
an unkempt man peels
a dyed egg

rainstorm
ants drink
from a droplet

fin du jour
il ferme le poulailler
entre chien et loup 

soir de tempête
l'effervescence de l'eau
dans la bouilloire 

damselflies
dart across the water
a bluer blue

Saint Valentin
les yeux tuméfiés
de la fleuriste 

crépuscule d'hiver
dans le souffle du ressac
les mots inutiles 

janvier doucereux
relire les haïkus
d'autres hivers 

nuit étoilée
le bonheur de pouvoir
pisser sous la lune 

partout sous ses pas
une chiffonnade de feuilles
l'odeur de la vie 

soirée d'automne
l'araignée aussi sommeille
sur la toile 

changement d'heure
le portail du voisin
couine plus tôt 

berges du marais
dans ce vieux saule l'automne
n'a laissé qu'un nid 

toute la nuit
elles arpentent les trottoirs
les feuilles mortes 

alerte météo
derrière les volets clos
un escargot 

August heat
the pregnancy test results
become clear

premiers froids
sur le pull de l'an passé
des poils de chat 

fin de saison
le klaxon du boulanger
de plus en plus tôt 

nuit étoilée
la grande Ourse accroche
l'antenne du voisin  

pluie d'orage
l'odeur des corps
dans le bus 

ciel nuageux 
cette nuit pleine lune 
sur le calendrier  

un ciel magnifique
Gaza drapé du couchant
beauté mortifère 

bouquets d'explosions
sous chaque fumerolle
invisible la chair 

la bulle éclate
faisant danser la lune -
vieille mare.

forêt de Lascaux

her famous blue haiku
about her divorce
and his cactus

perseids
we help mother blow out
sixty-three candles

soleil du matin
les miettes sur la table
ont une ombre

guitare et harmonica
dans mon auto bob dylan aussi
a encore 20 ans

autumn morning
the smell of fresh rain
in my coffee 

hunter's moon
the old tabby
refuses to come in

north winds –
snow flakes and
the smell of smoke

Orange sunrise peaks through
The tubes and wires of father's
Life support machine

late rising moon
fireflies decorate
the tamarind tree

moving day
my life
reduced to boxes

Autumn night --
Puddles by the wayside
filling with the stars

Cautiously the cat with each step measuring
the depth of the snow.

midnight jazz
rain streaming down
the verdigris chain 

Ponocni metro --
u opustelom vagonu
njisu se rucke

looking at the sky
dandelions with haircuts
oh, that wind, that wind

summer afternoon
the scent of evergreens
slowly spreading

under the oak
blue feathers
black cat

thunder storm--
on the sidewalk
earthworm slick


sudden thunderstorm-
open umbrellas flower
in many colors

night breeze
carries a moth
to the moon

lonely butterfly
in the quiet morning light
where are you going?

quiet dawn-
in the oak tree
mourning doves

Indian summer
turkey feather falling
just out of reach

the taste
of pine's bitter honey
these bitter tears

Tropical storm warning
Wet sand in our kisses
The opening sky

first time--
your curly hair
tickled my thighs

tornado
in the wreckage
a bird sings

Walking
quiet thunder
spring rain 

Balloon floats
Over garbage truck
Party is over

a butterfly
over the bouquets...
I tune out the speaker

sunny day
a wasp tastes
everyone's beer

spring frost --
the park cannon aimed
at the church

Brittle scent
of a summer storm
lightning's sillage

senior's home
we celebrate the new year
a 7:00 pm

heavy rain--
my flower seeds sprout
in the neighbor's yard

sepia souls smile
from a photo negative
reunion

roadside rest stop
he adds a haiku
to the graffiti

dull pencil
the staff meeting goes
on and on

A snowy footbridge
the sound of water
under the ice.

her black hair
veils our praying hands ...
hospice church at dusk

twilight moon --
a hole in the chestnut
fills with stars

offshoring jobs...
the last glow of sunset
at the horizon

a river behind the graveyard forget-me-nots 

Central Park
the echo of her voice
in every direction 

froid soudain -
elle lit et relit un livre
de confitures 

dimanche de Pâques -
un oignon
piqué d'un clou de girofle

faded postcard
the Nagasaki temple
then

jour d'hiver -
des montres luxueuses
à un prix abordable

matin de tempête-
le grille-pain dans la cuisine
à sa place

fin d'hiver-
enfin la neige
en fond d'écran

le trou de la sécu-
le chemisier rose pale
de la pharmacienne


nuit agitée...
elle se reveille en me parlant de
cigales

plage familiale-
les petits crabes vont
et viennent tranquillement

plage familiale-
les femmes font des pâtés
et gardent leur maillot

farine bio 65 -
une mite mâle
cherche une femelle

veille de fête des mères-
son plus beau chandail
bouffé par les mites 

entre 2 sardines
elle parle
de son pelerinage

summer heat
kimono hung on the wall
billows from the fan

72 ans
elle n'a jamais vu son vagin
soleil d'hiver

j'enfile mes chaussettes
elle me parle
de sucres lents

encore la nuit-
seule dans la cuisine
elle casse des noix 

nuit d'émeutes-
après le petit dej
ramasser les miettes

Intifada-
d'un portable à l'autre
la rage

Intifada-
d'un côté les cravates
de l'autre les Nike

Intifada-
un léger retard
pour le repas du soir

Couleurs printanières-
devant l'étalage des soutien-gorge
le photographe hésite


déménagements
après déménagements
les mêmes portemanteaux

Arbres de Judée en fleurs-
brumes et brouillard
sur la papauté

afternoon heat
tandem damselflies
bask on a reed

Lundi de Pâques-
absent depuis plusieurs jours
le chat est de retour

Le vent fou
dans le petit linge de ma voisine...
enceinte de 3 mois

Samedi soir-
un long moment à tailler
des crayons de couleur

Matin d'hiver-
le zizi du jardinier
tout rabougri...

Salle d'attente
une très vieille revue
de l'an 2000...

Avant de se quitter
disperser les braises -
envol des lucioles

Les ombres des entants
d'un feu à l'autre-
ciel étoilé

Juste avant l'hiver
un Bouddha de pacotille
son dernier cadeau

Un escargot
dans l'oeil droit de la citrouille-
lendemain d'Halloween

Sur le fil à linge
un oiseau en équilibre-
quelque part à Fallouja

silver dawn
slug traces iridesce
on the garden path

Le cliquetis du sécateur
dans les branches de l'oranger-
la météo annonce du froid

Les moustiques
dans ma nouvelle maison
ne m'ont pas suivi

Orage d'été
le petit linge de ma voisine
bien accroché

Après la pluie -
des capsules de bière
au bord du chemin

fin de l'hiver-
les graines de ciboulette
au creux de ma main

Late summer;
the greyness of dusk
without fireflies.

Herding sheep;
the prickly smell
of wet wool.

rock and roll métal…
dans la nuit une canette
roulée par le vent 

nuit glaciale :
dans les phares deux yeux bleus
venus de l’Est 

iceberg
un bout de son sein blanc
émerge 

sweltering stillness
the nurse flicks a bubble
from the syringe

Chaud réveillon
Seins au balcon
Place aux frissons 

bleu blanc douce
les couleurs musulmanes
des carreaux d'Iznik 

dans l'urne
ses espoirs ses idéaux
réduits en cendres 

printemps en ville 
les jeunes pousses
des jeunes filles 

sur son T shirt
en relief elle ranime
le Che 

beaujolais nouveau
la robe rouge
de la jeune caviste

presque un mois
sans faire un haïku?
parfums de printemps  

Maguelone en avril 
La jeune vigne vierge
n'est plus nue 

à son chant répond
les harpons du vieux Japon
baleine au printemps

le couple en vie
sur la vieille photo
rêve d'avenir

relentless sun
my lips meet the cool arc
flowing from the hose

hiver ou non
ses boutons à elle
sont ouverts

Noël au Japon
pas trouvé de mots de saisons 
pour les pendaisons 

fin de la nuit
les deux miroirs multiplient
verres et regards

plage déserte
sous un bout de bois roulé
deux fourmis 

plage naturiste.je sors de l'eau devant elle
diminué par le froid 

touristes en Provence
retrouvant dans les lavandes
l'odeur des WC

le jeu dans le sang
cherchant le bon numéro
dans son analyse 

marché aux puces
une culotte rose

marché aux puces
une culotte de femme

overgrown grapevine
unsigned divorce papers
heavy in my hand

de la bûche de pin fendue
un parfum d'été

paon de Maguelone
ses plumes bleu outremer
entre mer et ciel

overcast Sunday---
the lilacs
remind me of last night

le niveau baisse
les pattes des flamands roses
rallongent

Calligraphes au temple -
prières pour les blaireaux
donneurs de poils

terrasse au midi
toutes les ombres
sentent l'anis

après l'orage
tout le monde en bave
même l'escargot

sortie du métro
polyphonies corses
téléphoniques

sur la neige
un petit sac d'ordures bleu
couleur du ciel

Rain on a flat tin roof. Hammers without nails

all I need are mountains
and a hedgehog -
autumn deepens

this winter's day the garbage cans evanesce

winter solstice --
the Persian cat's half-
closed eyes

small town café
only strangers
get menus

après la dispute,
seulement le claquement
des perches à haricots 

To the Finland Station --
they rush
to strike a deal for iPhones

the metallic tang of deer's blood
dominates the forest

cat's paws crawling
across a lake's surface
morning silence

Croton hedges 
with their faux fall foliage
South Florida in autumn

blood on barbed wire
a pale moon
reveals the crime

Red fall foliage
the Sun at noon
glorious

They share 
a bruised apple
moonlit feast for two

Harvest moon --
too much light
for field mice

summer rains gone
the river
finds its own channel

his name 
on the black granite wall
and we must ask, why ?

after the argument only the snapping of pole beans

hellebore bloom that spring morning as tanks rumble 

rumble of thunder
rouses dawn
late summer in Miami

ash covers his school desk
all the remains
8:17 am -- Hiroshima, local time

brush in hand
he carefully...
8:16, local time, Hiroshima

in a pile of rubble
faint peeps are heard
rats, of course

ebb tide's retreat
and I grow older
recessionals 

tang of salt spray
at a fishing pier
late summer

lighting the way
with a jar of fireflies
childhood's last summer 

in the evening coolness
of a verandah
hereyes reflect stars

after a long night
the singing of birds
at dawn

wisp of clouds
the slow spiral of cream
in my espresso

Gazing at the moon
on a still summer's evening
feast for mosquitoes

Clouds gather
in a darkening sky
a walk interrupted 

a careful sip
more of chickpea than coffee
his breakfast brew

croaking of frogs
just after dawn
summer memories

silk from a web
entangled in my hair
a homeless spider 

Before dawn
By the small pond
The sound of crickets

chamomile petals
swimming in rainwater
for her blonde highlights

Splat !
a windshield and a bug
find each other

polished granite
reflects my face off
my father's grave

cold rain
sharp as nails
late afternoon

almost dusk - 
the zigzag flight
of linked dragonflies

El Hueso's dry bones
still wrapped in a uniform 
that he so disgraced.  

old, brittle, dry bones
found inside a uniform 
a past imperfect 

childhood's summer gift
that first dandelion
dancing on the wind

My tea gets colder
and the madeleine just sinks
memory betrays

a cooing is heard
from a small puff of feathers
another dawn

small green waves crashing
against a porcelain rim
morning tea tempest

in an old snapshot
his Irish smile still flashes
her slight, shy smile, too 

faces from the past
their memories in old photos
effaced by the flood

red poppies growing
between rows of white tombstones
as in remembrance

under a full moon
a homeless man gathers cans
urban harvest 

waiting
for my illness to end --
November rain
seeps slowly, slowly
into the ground

deep into the night
a dog's sharp bark
becomes gunfire

butterfly wings
so loud their flapping
in a temple's silence

sharp smell 
after a noon downpour
electric summer

rows of white markers
all at attention
Memorial Day

late morning breakfast
left uneaten
too much of spring

Just a small basket
filled with hidden treasures
she carries proudly

a yellowed clipping
falls out from her Bible
Emmett Till's obit

In front of bronze doors
they huddle against the cold
the newly homeless

early morning dew
on a bronze temple bell
just before ringing

clear lake enclosed
entirely within 
a bowl of miso

my body
aching and feverish
after nightfall --
the autumn wind rises

breakfast still rumbles
but no other guns are heard
Armistice morning.

he winds up his watch
so carefully that morning 
that will end the war

The bugler plays "Tap"
her face so serious
her parents, so proud

Ordinary morning
bluest of skies, crisp, clear air
until the shadows 

mid morning coffee
sipped from a chipped old mug
so comforting 

Rainbows reflected
in so many potholes
afternoon rainstorm

that spring day
the flowers have long faded
yet we remember

the mirror reflects
a face I know so well
dad's

a flagpole stands guard
before a flooded schoolhouse
as a river runs

perched on a guardrail
of a busy highway
an egret preens

three days
of cold autumn rain --
a dull ache
settles deep
inside my breasts

Cracks on a sidewalk
lost among the grass and weeds
urban spring

Cracked head statue
of the Buddha; a reminder
everything passes.

one plus one = 3 
a happy couple expecting
their first child

Fountain pen ink spill
not contained by a blotter 
Mare Crisium

she cries silently
her sobs barely audible
and no one to hear

rivulets of red
running down her pale young face
she clutches a doll

he turns one last time
flashing his sailor's wry smile
that bright November. 

the War on Horror---
G.I.'s on hashish kill
Afghans for sport

I turn off the pumpkin lights---
a predawn
harvest moon

white roadside crosses
where the road's swale meets Nature
memento mori

Sentinels of spring...
kites bobbing for attention
in saucy March winds

harvest moon gleaners
pale faces, leaden eyes stare
at an empty field

glassy-eyed, gutted
catch of the day on shaved ice
at the fish market

neither white nor black
a yellow smog that won't lift
Alzheimer's pall

Full Corn Moon
time to gather the harvest
before leaves fall

charred goat bones
they say -- without conviction 
Somali nightmares

too hot for miso!
he pushes it aside
that August morning

wildflower bouquet
left on a country highway
the endless road

tea leaves carefully
saved, dried, and used again
hidden poverty

there's a pelican
-- in that ball of feathers, tar
or it is a gull?

beneath the fireworks
endless bullfrogs

the crowd 
holding blossoms . . . 
thunder!

among new lilies she waters the stone Buddha 

white clouds
glide safely
over mine fields

homesick—
sundown just behind
the fence

spitting seeds
into a blue sky—
the old elm

forgetting to ask
for the seniors' rate-
falling leaves

just over the fence
a constellation of stars
and trucks

wildflowers
along my neighbor's wall
soften her voice

unexpected guest-
a thought came out
of nowhere

smell of rain
young deer run
across the field

winter rain 
the sheets where she slept 
grow colder

sifting shadows
with remnants
of rain

desert sand. . .
my sleeping bag under
a full moon

giant moon. . .
the bark of a dog echos
over the fence

crystalline sky
the pioneers left no clue
which trail to take

willow scent
a kingfisher hangs
in the air

desert heat-
smiles along the narrow road
to the deep north

spring trek
a rusted snowplow
at roads' end

sweet basil
dried snail tracks crisscross
the window box

Arizona
road stop rest, the dog sniffs
yellow snow

a moth flutters
over the candle flame . . .
damned idiot

still water . . .
the undercurrent
in her voice

storm warning...
a street corner argument
turns many heads

stars falling
from the sky . . .
autumn moon

November winds
the dog finds dead birds
in the hedge

desert cemetery-
my sister in law
does not weep

summer ends-
her freckles pale
in dark tan

highway fog-
the honking of geese
homeward bound

desert wind-
iron and copper flavor
in my coffee

spring day-
the wall clock
still winter

appalachian spring-
carbide carbuncles
in the coal oil light

moon hare-
bloody gloves lay
on the ice

frosty dawn-
the dog watches me
pack my bag

campfire coffee. . .
condor wings glean
the first rays of sun

making pancakes
between whispers . . .
morning mist

arctic air
soothes the desert heat . . .
blended whiskey

slate skys
chalk mark outlines
on the sidewalk

peach moon . . .
the thin slice left
for us

grassy moon
we slip off our shoes
to count the stars

garden embrace
the fresh smell of her
sun dried laundry

kitchen embrace
the smell of her hot
apple pie

farewell embrace
a faint essence
of mothballs

montana morning
the horses with their backs
to blowing snow

street light sway ~
dreams of her linger
with the storm

Sack of cheeries ~
clouds grow dark on the road
to the coast

humid morning . . .
words dangle
from her lips

salmon sunrise
a splash resounds over
the calm bay

farmer's market
she paints a flower
on a child's cheek

tandem bicycle
wind in our hair
a shared laugh

misty morning
echoes of blue jay cries
through the pines

fresh brewed coffee
cream and sugar swirls
she stirs in her thoughts

spring breeze
blowing dandelions
in circles

dry haystack
flames climb higher
against the night sky

rainy morning
the haijin stirs
sugar in his coffee

alabaster moon ~
glowing among bare pine tops
in cool mountain mist

kissing her slowly
where the rain
never falls

humid night . . .
the darkness
between your thighs

Passover darkness -
before the buds burst open;
a child's eyes in death.

desert garden
frosted lettuce leaves
in the pink dawn

old park bench
i touch our initials
each time i pass

new housing--
hammer and saw replace
the dove's coo

christmas services
a cellular phone rings out
handel's messiah

no island
in the bay today
morning fog

stop sign
thru the bullet holes
ghetto moon

November fog;
not a tree
to be seen.

Purple loosestrife;
pale in the
lingering mist.

A cold morning;
the pink of tulips
through the mist.

upstairs, swathed
in neon, the
scent of jasmine

a movement of deer
into twilight
suddenly spring

fireflies competing
with a full moon
summer solstice

the way grass parts
as the pheasant passes
spring's end

moonlessness--
so many ways
I want to touch you

earth day--
even the shadows at dusk
smell green

fading
right before my eyes
morning moon

light rain
on sweet, sweet clover
late summer's dusk

winter rain
the confusion in her voice
all over again

This morning the geese
have taken over the skies
in wild abandon
how sudden this stillness then
and now how I have missed you

morning moon
filling up my window
autumn's end

lanternless night . . .
a whisper passing
through leaves

autumn twilight
captures the mood of leaves
swirling everywhere
in this circular motion
hear the laughter of children

white cloud of a moon
drifting in the morning sky
these October days
how like a fine mist that fades
this future now so fragile

summer's end
the tenderness
of light

after loving-making
scent of wild clover
through the window

my children and I
race to see the sunset
before it fades
how tenuous time now seems
slipping away from my reach

after the dream
the scent of approaching rain
in the dusty air

blackbird song -
the name of a daughter
i'll never know

begrafenis -
vast in een antieke vaas
luchtbel

najaarsregens
op weg naar het oude huis
nieuwe oevers

file -
mijn autoradio tussen
twee zenders

a slower
moon this evening . . .
the cold!

het laatste blad -
zijn witte adem lost op
in de tuin

nazomer
het reuzenrad draait
tegen de klok in

zomermiddag
het jongetje voor het schoolraam
leest de wolken

dwarrelend
op de trampoline
kersenbloesems

kite shop -
entering with every customer
the summer breeze

lenteregen
verf bladdert
van de tuinkabouter

vallend blad - 
het afnemende licht vult
traag mijn kamer

eerste afspraakje
dicht bij elkaar 
om het menu te bestuderen

zonsopkomst
van dorp naar dorp
hanengekraai

tandartspraktijk
in de wachtkamer een rij
vergeelde stoelen

autumn depths . . .
a mole dreaming
of darkness

herinneringen
het roet
op de dakpannen

museumhal
kinderen bestuderen
hun echo's

vroege vorst
de koude kant 
van het bed

decemberregen ...
iemand zijn mening
op een muur

reflet dans la vitre
de son visage en pleurs -
bruit sourd de la pluie 

à la fin du jour
l'ombre du chêne traverse
la rue du village 

posées sur Le Monde
les lunettes à l'envers -
quelle fatigue! 

Thanksgiving Day
délicat fumet de dinde -
ciel roussi d'Irak

sortant du métro
face à face avec la lune -
retour du boulot 

la pleine lune
au-dessus du gratte-ciel -
il est minuit

the egg seller . . .
her cracked hands
speak of winter

à la Toussaint
les trompettes de la mort -
cinq ou six

Jour d'action de grâce -
récoltes généreuses
achetées à vil prix

le soleil levant -
dans la vitre givrée
un amas d'étoiles

70 mph
the infant snores
a bit slower

winter night
finding my pajama bottoms
on my wife

putting a cork
in last night's wine
late autumn

the glass jar
full of fireflies
bedtime

evening sky
counting some fireflies
more than once

smell of rain -
soft ridges of mint leaves
oil my fingers

remembering summer
how brittle the leaves
underfoot

high noon . . .
young girls harvest
rice from a mirror

summer rain
the smell of earth
in the air

watching clouds
the white petals
of a crushed crocus

smells of spring
adrift in the morning air
bubbles under ice

after the rain
moon and stars
underfoot

my wife
home from hospital
hibiscus in full bloom

My 72nd winter
the deepening cold
in every room 

month-old obit
of an ex-girl friend
unexpected rain

back and forth
across our conversation
fireflies

death watch ended
the rain storm
begins

my wife
home from the hospital
hibiscus in full bloom

spring
a few blocks closer
than yesterday

after the storm,
an egret fording
darkness

at opposite ends
of the reading room
ex-lovers

despite my assurances
my wife's makeup
thicker

somewhere
behind the old barn
end of the rainbow

despite the day's heat
mum's tombstone
so cold

thunderstorms
all day long
broken promises

hot chocolate
the scent stronger
this cold night

late night rain
the crickets finally
silent

nothing
in our bedroom
but moonlight 

sunset traffic
slowly down the hill
into darkness

at the crossroads
no wind to give
a direction

early spring . . .
young women collecting
peach blossoms

smalltown street
sunset and moonrise
at opposite ends

slow afternoon
the rain changes
to drizzle

home alone
the cold
of an autumn rain 

silent night
the fog thick
at every window

late night traffic
the swirl of leaves after
the last bus

deep deep deep cold
the lengthening pauses between
her words

while making love
the last icicle
falls

bad news from home
the cold morning
colder still

voices
in the cemetery
remembrance day

slow afternoon
the rain changes
to drizzle

after midnight . . .
a shooting star beneath
the wharf

after the argument
the storm clouds also
break up

pouring rain
yet another question
without an answer

graveside sermon ended
the last leaves blown from
a nearby tree

63 today
nothing from here to the horizon
but fair weather clouds

start of a new season
a book loaned
to a new friend

summer solstice    the wind still cold

right after
morning prayers
distant thunder

mountain storm
somewhere during its echo
the thunder ends

60 today
the full moon
still rising

somewhere
in the graveyard
birdsong

mid-summer . . .
she shares with me
a ripe melon!

also
in the fog
the scent of autumn

cold dark night
the warmth of her hand
in mine

snow and rain mixed
my angry words
and her tears

death
of an old friend
my cup empty

pelting rain
on the car radio
nothing but blues

behind the man
in the open doorway
nothing but darkness

the gap
between the mountains
filled with fog

spring breeze--
between pages of an old book
a crushed rose

bedtime --
trying not to count
maimed solders

indian summer
the viagra stock
deflates

no longer a
mirror, this lake chasing
geese into darkness

late season
christmas lights illuminate
a golden buddha

Fly,
be afraid!
No Buddhists in this house!

after the fireworks . . . the thunder moon

huddled cows
their steam thickens
the valley mist 

for a moment
the gull in the air
is very white

leap year
looking a her twins
a squinting woman ---

less cars
in front of the brothels
valentine's day ---

on my smartphone
mount fuji in the sunset
morning coffee ---

after the bell
just the rain on the umbrellas
ashes to ashes 

for just a moment
the warmth of our tears
cold rain

almost summer . . .
eating an especially
ripe mango

the evasive look
of a teen without make up
first buds

her cooled tea
in the middle of the table
first snow --- 

evening tram
her diamond on her nose
a star --- 

more piercing
in the autumn mist
the blackbird's song

asleep
a golden dot on her ear
bus forty one

emptied fountain
carried by the autumn wind
silt scent

matin de mars
regarder vers l'est
fukushima 

soleil froid
dans le parlement
leurs hurlements 

the silence
of the april rain
after the shower

tempête d'hiver
une goutte traverse la vitre
de goutte en goutte 

gusts of wind
dancing together under
a harvest moon

soleil d'automne
les pas de mon père
plus lents

un point plus sombre
dans la neige de l'échographie
pleine lune d'automne

pleine lune --
après la soupe aux potirons
son ventre plus rond

dans le brouillard
de mon haleine se perd
le train du soir 

sur le pont
les gens plus pressés
pluie d'été

chutes de neige
le sachet de thé s'enfonce
lentement dans l'eau

sous ma paume
ses seins plus gros
soleil d'hiver

soir de décembre
sur l'écran de l'échographie
que de la neige

crépuscule d'hiver
l'ombre de l'épouvantail
dépasse le champ

lentement
le scarabée avance
tempête de juin

the fullness
of ripe melons . . .
this summer moon

pleine lune
l'ombre de ses seins
se pose sur moi

rentrée des classes --
encore un peu de marée haute
tout près des dunes

début mars
sur la carcasse du chien
les premières mouches

marée basse -
dans le fortin écartelé
le cadavre d'un chien

soleil couchant
sur la vitre du quatrième
la trace d'un oiseau

sous cassiopée
un grillon

autour de la lune
lentement, la brume
au-dessus des grillons

regarder la lune
bouger derrière le chêne
vent d'été

eau calme
deux cygnes s'ébattent
eau calme

fraîcheur d'automne
donner à manger à un enfant
de quatre-vingts ans

summer leaves . . .
remembering
mother's dry skin

samedi matin
sous le cerisier du japon
une flaque rose

la grande ourse
bougeant sur l'eau
pluie de printemps

soir de printemps
on cause tranquillement
près des violettes

soir bleu
les violettes
invisibles

ex-girlfriend
with a baby carriage
spring rain

cette nuit
une poule d'eau perturbe
la grande ourse

première neige
un adolescent paumé
mort d'une overdose

nouvelle lune
rien sur le lac
que le cri des poules d'eau

nuages bas
écouter la neige
nuit blanche

parfums de tarte tatin
ma grand-mère cuisine
dans l'album photo

a mountain,
the stone buddha . . .
and cold food

haïku
écrit dans le métro
illisible

vendredi soir
le silence du bureau
sur mon clavier

after the fireworks
he marvels
at the moon

cinq heures du matin
derrière l'épais brouillard
l'odeur du pain frais

dans le rétroviseur
le regard d'amour de la mère
pour sa fille qui récite

in the empty schoolyard
only plastic bags
are going the rounds

sur le goulot
le parfum de ses mains
boire goulûment

un bic à la main
elle compte ses vidanges
et moi ses atouts

comme l'année dernière
le cerisier en fleurs
cache les buildings

ouvrir la fenêtre
et humer le lilas blanc
éclos cette nuit

first day of spring
stubborn icicles 
still hang on

daybreak
your kiss on the lip
of a coffee cup

des ronds dans le sable
et puis des ronds dans l'eau
marée basse et puis haute

fresh autumn breeze
or the advance of age?
forgotten tea...

moonless night
a cereus cactus opens
solstice blooms

sudden gust
carp leap from poles
to gulp the air

chill wind
beneath the monk's robe
a naked monk

screen of pine
white silence glides
on egret wings

sand through fingers
a tracery of palms
on midnight blue

silken winds
i am wrapped in quietness
of cottonwood seeds

back and forth
grinding ink slowly
the weight of my words

spring nightfall
ink melts
over stone

the full moon
and a rice field
planted with stars

fogged window
a blend of green and gray -
hot tea with milk

morning fog
dissolving cypress -
sfumato

slice of moon
the scent of jasmine spills
into thick darkness

brilliant Venus drips
from a gold crescent moon
this night as the first
the eve of thirty years
veiled in ultramarine

la pluie
dans le paysage jauni 
de septembre 

le homard du dessus
avec ses yeux en forme de boutons
me fixe 

août
tous les insectes chanteurs
jour et nuit 

un peu de vent
sur mes épaules nues
odeur de matin 

matin d'été
un champ d'orge encore vert
entoure l'abbaye en ruines

des fleurs
coupées précocement
sur le trottoir

day moon . . .
a paper lantern floating
down river

les hautes herbes
courbées sous l'aile de la buse
midi

voeu d'obéissance
les hautes herbes courbées
dans l'harmattan

la sève
coule à flanc d'érable
gélivures

les feuilles rouges
les premières à tomber
un porto ce soir

jardin zen
les stèles émergent du sable
un autre soldat mort

tra i lampi
il suono della cavalletta
ancora un poco

pleine lune -
il manque deux soirs
à sa rondeur

ses cheveux coiffés
à l'abri du vent sud-ouest
tombe ouverte

il prolonge
la soufflerie de l'ordinateur
le grillon 

attendre le matin
le soleil au bout des branches
de l'érable

kissing you
under a paper moon . . .
the stars!

les enfants font
flotter des lanternes de couleur
soir d'Hiroshima 

changing winds
bring up your kite
and the Dow

solstice d'été
les jours plus longs
les écrits plus courts

le vent de printemps
disperse les fleurs du magnolia
ses dix-neuf ans

chez l'antiquaire --
au fond de l'armoire vide
les rais du soleil

courber la tête
en passant sous le lilas
lourd de neige

la dernière note
avant qu'elle monte dans l'autobus
matin froid d'hiver

passer--
entre l'ombre de l'érable
et la lune

tombée du jour
suivre la guerre sur l'écran
dormir sans rève

dernière lune
avant l'irradiation
Hiroshima

cool morning . . .
your smile pasted on
a coffee cup

pissing in a puddle
droplets of moonlight
on her sandal

indian summer
the neighbor's daughter sunbathes
beside their empty pool

chill night
new fallen pear blossoms
glow in the moonlight

fresh cut lawn
a dozen fireflies
inspect the job

windstorm
the berry stains
on the path

amid war
and rumors of war. . .
another grandchild

spring cleaning
long neglected baseball cards
see the light of day

long night
the waterfall's
icy silence

gale winds
the stone Buddha
remains centered

beautiful orange butterfly
lands on his shoulder~
oblivious

a monkey listens
to his own breath . . .
autumn rain

trembling
the hair ribbon falls
with inhibitions

jury duty
the clock pendulum goes
back and forth

summer breeze--
someone practices drums
in the valley

no rain--
the sound of crunched
grass

museum--
so hot the mummy
sweats

summer rain--
drops descend the lily
leaf by leaf

hail storm
the golfers run
for cover

night sax. . .
dreams in
B flat

between
thunder and lightning
zero

I rescue
a mouse from the cat--
burnt steak

watching
my wife's ashes float by. . .
autumn moon

construction noise
outside

the letter

on a saxophone

in the flashlight

butterflies

in rice field shadows . . .

same path
even in deep snow—
the blind horse

between the lines

rouging her cheeks
as she waits for a drink

food channel
between commercials
dinner burns

evening service --
light beams
into the night

 food channel --
between commercials,
dinner burns

autumn
along the highway
buzzards wait

mountain cave --
from out of darkness
the morning light

after its first flight
the young gerfalcon's talons
tighter on my glove

the night scented
with laundry soap

m'a réveillée ?

de fleurs blanches 

papier défraîchi -
tes mains fraîches sur mes hanches
- chambre quatre 

seule ce soir 
une goutte après l'autre 
quelque part  

tas de repassage - 
dans la jupe de l'été 
trois pignons de pins  

Entrée du bois -
débris de faïence WC
sous l'églantier en fleur

grêlons -
la pointe du sein
entre pouce et index

autumn cool . . .
wondering what an ant thinks
about after work

sieste -
ma main sur mon sein
la fuite des nuages

matin d'octobre -
sur la barque rouge
le héron

pendu par les pieds
le chevreuil dépecé
plus loin, les perce-neiges

soleil levant
elle dessine sa bouche
dans le retro

troisième jour d'école
dans son cartable si lourd
dix fois le silence

extrême onction
les ventres qui gargouillent
le merle dehors

porte entrouverte -
les guirlandes s'illuminent
une seconde

matin d'hiver -
gelée de myrtilles
mes seins si blancs ! 

rue Saint Honoré
dégringolée de nulle part
la feuille de ginkgo

feux d'artifice...
crier de joie à la vue
du ver luisant

in the clouds,
a fish i haven't
seen before

Juno Beach-
mon corps dans la mer,
ma mère au bord

rage de dents -
sur le toit les serres
des pigeons

soir de mai,
les carottes sauvages dépassent
l'horizon

 chemin de l'école
deux vaches portent avec leurs cornes
le soleil

Nella trincea
della guerra mondiale
cresce erba alta

Pioggia cadente
un rumore continuo
di gocce grigie

nell'ospedale
la notte aggiunge ombre
dentro il buio

pioggia di notte
si alternano colori
sopra l'asfalto

Acqua che scorre
porta via i miei pensieri
un fiume in piena

Nel secchio d'acqua
sotto il cielo di notte
luna riflessa

Una pagoda
nel bosco di sambuchi
soffio di vento

summer rain . . .
the mountain sinks
into a rice field

Una "giulietta"
nei fari senza vetro
ha un ciuffo d'erba

Cammina piano
immerso nel delirio
gilet macchiato

Cioccolatino
ripieno di liquore
brivido caldo

Pinta di birra
ci affoga beatamente
un moscerino

Volo di notte
l'argento della luna
sulla carlinga

Zanzara morta
fiore rosso schiacciato
sulla parete

Sulle fiancate
che graffiò il cacciavite
molti adesivi

Lisca di pesce
il muso del merluzzo
guarda lontano

Mazzo di fiori
sulle foglie in basso
una lumaca

Chiodo ricurvo
nel muro unico segno
d'un vecchio quadro

high noon . . .
fish in the marketplace
gasping for water

Dopo la festa
ghirlanda colorata
appesa al muro

Gatto che dorme
con il suo pelo grigio
cielo da neve

Schumann concerto
la voce della pioggia
lo accompagna

Verso l'aurora
stridule sghignazzate
dei gabbiani

Notte d'inverno
cigola il vecchio tram
sulle rotaie

Campo dei fiori
aleggia ancor nell'aria
fumo del rogo

Piazza deserta
coi resti del mercato
e sono solo

Canto di gallo
al sorgere del sole
dall'oriente

Liberazione:
la carcassa del Panzer
ora è fiorita

donne di Gaza
senza lacrime gli occhi
luna d'inverno

the stillness of
a moth that didn't
reach the moon

fin d'été
dans les bagages
les habits d'automne 

chaleur écrasante

garden wedding --
under the cherry blossoms
the bride's blush deepens

rainy New York
from the tenth storey window
black umbrellas bloom

drunk on the beach-
the moon in my sake cup
disappears

late winter -
opening the saijiki
to early spring

faintly purple
against the moon -
pines in the light

the last light of day ~
purple rhododendrons
dissolve in the dark

full moon
only you at my window
an empty face
did loneliness wipe away
the last traces of passion ?

irises
bluer
in hers

petals pressed
between pages of a book
i never read

wisteria -
blooming before
the end of rain

through lace ~
the tracery of frost
on glass

rain
falls from the trees
on the blue iris

winter beach -
three grey lines
of sand, sea and sky

winter -
white peonies
in falling snow

l'ultima rosa
ha le foglie arricciate
gelo notturno

vecchia lettera
un cerchietto d'argento
dentro la busta

sera d'inverno
tra due treni mi sento
di passaggio

dal cassonetto
fa capolino una
stella dorata

vento di notte
per la strada soltanto
una lattina

dawn haze -
the bulbul's trills
so clear

winter solstice--
her passing
bends the candle's flame

bamboo depths . . .
a carp circles
your smile

La tazza di tè
è finalmente vuota
fumo d'incenso

bruma sui campi
s'intravvedono appena
le zolle smosse

rompe il silenzio
la ninnananna negra
là sopra il molo

dopo la pioggia
il bucato sventola
nel cielo azzurro

sotto la pioggia
sull'ultimo gradino
ti sei voltata

tozzo di pane
dentro una pozzanghera
barbone a pesca

Volo di notte
sulle ali d'aereo
strisce di luna

giorno di sole
finalmente sul pino
una cicala

cielo di nubi
dell'aereo soltanto
il suo motore

strada deserta
l'attraversa un gatto
coda al vento

short night . . .
thoughts of you and
a paper thin moon

suono di passi
un calcio a una lattina
e poi silenzio

re in armatura
un mantello di neve
sulle sue spalle

Ghetto al mattino
in fila, infreddoliti,
contro il muro

nel crepuscolo
ardono le falene
sulla lampada

come ogni notte
le voci nella strada
lillà fiorito

three petals fall
from the purple coneflower...
almost summer

instant message--
moon reveals more
of herself each night

fishing boats
colors of
the rainbow

ash wednesday--
trying to remember 
my dream

japanese quake
this godless spring
tsunami

speaking
to her ashes
between summer moons

snowy morn--
pouring another cup
of black coffee

shortest day
flames dance
in the oven

another
explosion
in baghdad
spring sun

the kettle.filled with snow,
hunger moon

haze
half the horse hidden
behind the house

low sun
the lady in red
on high heels

advent
the passing stranger
farts

tarn
a bubble in
the ice

snowflakes
new asphalt
in the holes

Crystal Night'
   gusts of rain
      outside

humid day---
her t-shirt refuses
to dry

rain
the sound of a horse galloping
through leaves

winter stars
suddenly a whiff
of perfume

hungry
half of the moon
hidden

rain
another leaf
down

sharia
the sound of one hand
clapping

the sound of geese
drowned by the sound of the train
this morning

dark
clouds
a pigeon
on the last
streetlight

the stench
of a dead sheep
in summer
rain

autumn sun
my shadow over
tombstones

fly fishing;
the sound of the wind
in the reel

day moon---
her skin a half
shade lighter

december
a long shadow
joins another

end of path
snowflakes melting
on the pond

morning frost
she leaves
first

on CNN
if you listen carefully
you can hear

evening walk
smell of tar between
pines

dachau
a blue sky above
the chimneys

Deep autumn;
The apple colder
In the tree.

visiting the graves
stronger the October wind
at my grandparents'

over the hedge
a dragonfly
east

a bubble
bursts on surface
full moon

memories of her
floating in a leftover
cup of tea

rain
the white lilac
low

my hand
    on her hip
         full moon

summer grass---
my mother's
rice paper skin

laying in bed
with dreams plucked
from summer rain just you . . .
and the scent
of melon

moonless night---
remembering
her small breasts

short night---
an egret standing
knee deep in mud

lakeside
the fog makes the loon's call
much more haunting

twilight
watching my shadow
float downriver

sipping more than
just tea----
the moon in passing

eyeing
the apple
at buddha's feet

the farmer,
planting corn under
a pregnant moon

drunk tonight---
an elixir of cherry blossoms
and moonlight

memories
floating in a tea cup---
autumn moon

his shadow
passes me by---
the charcoal seller

the potter's fingers
wet with clay---
first rain

saying the rosary
a laborer
planting rice

rainy night---
her phone number
in my wallet

river road
he stops to buy
a can of worms

cold night
the clink of bottles
in a grocery cart

contemplating
nightfall---
the stone buddha

the offering
in front of the stone buddha
eaten by cats

between two rivers,
the echo of
his mallet

sunday afternoon---
a steam train
pushes back the fog

eating rice---
how many stars are
in the sky ?

falling leaves---
a trail of clothing
leads to the bed

biting his nails,
a little boy watches
the outgoing tide

cold night---
my reflection
sipping coffee

moon viewing---
just me and spider
tonight

the moose grunts.again.
the nylon tent walls
seem thinner

moon viewing---
warming my hands
with a cup of coffee

all hallows eve---
stars paint the
cemetery ground

all saints day---
spent candles
in the cemetery

dark clouds---
a student drawing
with charcoal

egrets
plucking shadows
at dusk

fading this
autumn night---
the heron's legs

sculpting
clay, the potter
at dawn

master wind
sweeping the temple
zealously

house cleaning---
the forest fire
at dawn

metal birds
fly south to the
forest fire

steady rain~~
she rants about her boss
all through supper

even my pee
stays inside this
cold winter night

snowfall---
a milk mustache
on my daughter's face

geese honking---
children in the
bathtub playing

lakeside,
below the egret---
a city of lights

thousands of miles
away, her first birthday---
fresh mango

swimming across
the moonlit sky---
a gray carp

half moon
darkness drinking from an
alabaster teacup

floating
down river
an egret's shadow

dried wheat grass---
a bleached blond
combing her hair

no stars
in the sky tonight
hungry carp

first frost warning -
she no longer
pours his coffee

burning leaves
this foggy evening---
two kinds of smoke

waiting for winter---
eating rice balls
under a full moon

scooping steamed rice,
the laborer
at sundown

windswept afternoon---
tea scent
on my tongue

thank you, mango---
for a moment i was
somewhere else

passing cars
replace sheep
this sleepless night

reoccurrence
of cancer ---
no spring this year

gentle
on my window
summer rain
and his whispers rising
falling, rising. . .

in memory of Quentin Crisp:

season of mists. . .
a calling of wild geese
arrows south

afternoon card parties
the rumor mill's
farm system 

amber leaves
caught between 'for sale'
and 'sold'

again and again -
news of his wife's death

old manor house
each empty room has
its own echo

slender grasses
and warm summer rain
touching the buddha

into dusk
the white rose
still whiter

carousel music
the little girl's smile
comes round again

winter ennui ... coming down with a slight touch of clouds 

a ladder leans
into the scent of apples ...
orchard fog

brewing storm ...
how the clouds stir
in my coffee 

skin mapping
the familiar constellations
on his back

recycling--
old stories get a new twist
at the rumor mill

only the glow
of a paper lantern
new moon

alighting
on the edge of night
barn owl

brussel sprouts
only the bitterness left
on our table

brewing storm ...
how the clouds stir
in my coffee

a touch 
of bluegrass ...
spring 

the noir
of a beetle's carapace
passing rain

bobble and bounce
of the last marshmallow ...
hot cocoa 

cutting flowers ...
a honeybee lingers
in the empty space

the first scent 
of pink jasmine
open book

wet wooly mittens
drying by the hearth side
the smell of wet sheep

city hall scandal
the town's rumor mill
adds a third shift

the rhythmic lift
of her childbearing hips
high tide 

another way out ...
a backdoor slammin'
in the wind 

Beware of Dog
only the wildest flowers
go in there

the visual feast
of the first plum blossom
hunger moon

left behind
his scent of aftershave
on my cheek 

wolf call
in the distance ...
ice moon

the hollow sound
of sacred earth landing
six feet below

mud-spattered pickup-
four dogs watch
the tavern door

spring fever
my heartbeat quickens
through the avalanche zone

spring morning-
the urge to skip
and the wisdom not to

mid April
even in the shadows
the ice melts

power outage
hoarfrosted pines
shimmer in moonlight

red sky-
our boat flag frayed
by 20 summers

rumble of thunder-
slicing just-picked peaches
for the pie

spring fever
my pockets full
of old grocery lists

spring rain
I read his letters
one last time

the familiar wail
of a common loon-
your empty chair

Thanksgiving evening
the call of wild ducks
out on the bay

drumming rain
a patchwork of dreams
just before waking

the trail narrows-
every shadow
a possible bear

lingering grief-
calls of southbound geese
through misty rain

that cricket -
it's THERE
or THERE! 

avalanche warnings -
more tails of rain
and radiation 

lingering light
through the willows
scent of rain

obsidian night
the white sound
of rain

a steady drizzle-
all day the weight
of things unsaid

sleet ticking windows--
the chemo drip
in its last hour

evening shadows
on the walls of the Alamo
graffiti

autumn chill
faint chimes
from our oldest clock

dusty knickknacks
I try to recall
the scent of burning leaves

midsummer morning--
the boat's gentle tug
at the anchor 

an old woman
with a lost look in her eyes--
chilled wind

woodsmoke and fog
along the river bank
three trails meet

winter returns
one stubborn maple still drips
ever.so.slowly

searcher's call
the lost child's name-
streetlamps veiled with rain

journey's end
far off in the blue distance
dark clouds

ice moon-
a berry branch
forced into bloom

avalanche warning-
how very still
this winter night

our dusty truck-
an Amish man walks barefoot
across the village green

that long-ago kiss--
and still Orion strides
the winter sky

bitter cold--
we don't chase the lone crow
from the sparrow's food

deepening snow--
she leaves our atlas open
to her homeland

warmed-over coffee--
the gray gray sound
of winter rain

3:00 a.m.--
through sounds of winter rain
the mail plane landing

head cold -
running out of tissue
before noon

no wind tonight
across this reach of prairie
all those stars

sipping fresh cider--
both dippers
among the far stars

cool morning--
at the top of the rise
deer pass in the fog

meditation room--
books of wisdom
lean left . . . and right

turning north--
sand from both oceans
in little jars

the wind all night
rips limbs from the trees-
a long wait for dawn

nearly 60 --
so many mountains around me
still unclimbed

a B-52
thunders over the bay--
blue heron lifting

atop the high wall...
the intertwining of
barbed wire  roses

after brief rain...
petrol rainbows appear
on the tarmac

patience.
on the dock he sits beside
a can of worms

mist and rain-
from the dark church
we walk into light

uphill country walk...
on the verge wild plants
thriving in a carrier bag 

fading light
with its own tiny rainbow
the lake's fountain

recycling point...
one bin's slot is sealed
with a spider's web

after warm rain...
by the river the scent
of garlic  earth

after the storm...
stuck to the window
two leaves side by side

five counties, then
at the horizon
Betelgeuse

concert in full flow...
mingling with the music
the smell of cooking

washing-up done-
through netted windows
a fading sunset

the silence
between us-
filled with sunlight

early storm warning
he sends the kids
to the neighbors

falling leaves more of the sky

moon on the wane
the sound of wings
at dusk

desert dream
the sound of foghorns
on the Solent

ageing skin
the warmth and softness
of a baked apple

open windows -
all the contrails
feathering

spring clarity
the local pub reveals
its old name

poetry books
banished to the bathroom -
spring cleaning

solar flare -
spring moon half-hidden
in the clouds

February rain -
the word 'spring'
on the Scrabble board

February wind -
the word 'crocus'
on the Scrabble board

thin ice
he critiques her gravy
in front of the guest

sudden rainstorm
my place in another world
kept by a bookmark

Satie -
the rain
eases

Chinese market -
a row of small gold buddhas
share a smile

pension plans
the slow drone of a plane
coming in to land

strategic plan -
the sound of distant
foghorns

light rain -
water workers
dig a hole in the road

February sun -
a street light still on
in the daytime

the smell of varnish
lingers in the hall
like winter

Valentine's Day -
recycling
old gold

grey day
the only bright spot
a red traffic light

a hint of autumn 
that slight pause before she plucks
her first gray hair

cold rain
the greengrocer stacks cabbages
on cabbages

a window frames
the whole free world
in one white gull

between
the Prime Minister's words
birdsong

new year
fireworks
in a misty sky

late summer
graffiti overgrown
with ivy

evening sky
over fallen petals
a dark rose

a drop of ink -
tadpoles wriggle
on the water's surface

spring storm -
the grey dawn briefly
luminous

too soon the darkness
your last words lingering
in mist

moon and mist ~
night settles into silence
and white breath

sweltering heat
the cicadas buzz louder
during her hot flash 

my dead mother's voice
on the answering machine
. . . again and again . . .

summer sunset ~
the slow glide of a heron
into shadows

young girls in fog --
the fleet movement of hands
fluffing tobacco

Chechnya ~
blackened bones and ashes
smouldering

new leaves
pattered by rain . . .
cardinal song

new year...
a magpie turns over
an old leaf

chirping birds --
the instant I press
the stop button

Tonights light rainfall
Wraps me in soft silence
On my short walk home

examinations ...
blank sheets as students
observe the falling leaves

marble moon ...
the staccato of high heels
at rush hour

right turn
the clink of church keys
at the tea party

sampling my husband's
home-made wine ...
autumn evening

stuck in traffic
dreaming of the monsoon
in a far-away land

at the window
the drumming of rain ...
I catch up on sleep

this morning the sun
a fried egg on a plate
of blue china

doves
on the TV antenna
war on TV

winter window
closed to the cold -
purple orchid

sunflowers in bloom 
white flags
marking bodies

honeysuckle breeze
someone honks when
the light turns green

I wake beside
my daughter's sick bed
a howling dog

night of meteorites --
enjoying the sound of rain
instead

fall migration
custom combiners harvest
their way north

in winter's wind
the call of a friend
who now has cancer

harvest moon
i gather my thoughts
for winter

autumn melancholy
the click of mahjong tiles
from the computer

May clouds
new names and dates
in the family book

apricot blossoms
the birth of our first
granddaughter

blades of grass
between the flagstones ...
Easter afternoon 

Monday moon
the bent backs
of rice farmers

spring morning
finding an old flame
on Facebook

spring evening
an old love letter
from my husband

summer traffic
four cars, a tractor
and the full moon

black ice--
dad's last radiation
treatment 

mid February
the first garden seeds display
at the hardware store

winter night
too many stars
above Gaza

wall-to-wall clouds
and the hum of flies
summer dust

dead-end road
at the edge of the field
a new-born calf

harvest moon
the sound of women
pounding rice

winter evening
a teacup of mint
and moon

half moon
on the river the sound
of cracking ice

falling snow ...
she brings his urn closer
to the window

attractive
even in red
an oak leaf

autumn mist...
what is she doing now
my mother?

September rain ...
unaware of any pain
a peach falls

early sign of spring
snow shovels become
half-priced sale items

old temple
but all my prayers
are new

murmurings
in the old temple
summer wind

summer rain ...
drinking tea to the cadence
of falling leaves

warm afternoon
a fly with nowhere
to go

flat moon ...
an aspirine tablet and a
glass of water

the teacup
as empty as
my evening

a teacup
to fill
my afternoon

my day
measured out
in teaspoons

November moon
the last ball of cheese
in the fridge

The New Millenium
brought to my window
two new icycles

dark days of winter
the dentist explains his
payment plans

first spring snow
I release my soul in
my first yoga class

free floating
a tide full of shell fragments
and fireworks 

morning glories
find their way to the sun
on barbed wire

at half-mast
a butterfly passes by
the still flag

Origami

Those stars.
No more fish
in the bay.

apple slices-
our last words
in the knife's blade

no more war
two fighting beetles
on a tombstone

near the wall
of the cemetery
a condom

during the vigil
a withered flower
on the tiled floor

new age Luddite
he buys a dozen
paperback books 

a chill ~
just before the drizzle
wind chime notes

rail track
amidst the corn fields
bisected infinity

chasing bubbles
near the floating moon
a paper boat

inching up
on the rainwashed eucalyptus
rising moon
il gravit lentement
les eucalyptus délavés de pluie
le lever de lune 

dusty haze
at the sunrise time 
a yellow rose

daylight
in the winter haze
a faint birdsong

morning fog
my new dahlias too
look so faded 

between Lake Erie
and the nuclear station
fireflies

a dew drop 
full 
of autumn light

heavy leaves
in the evening rain
heaps of darkness

dark days of winter 
the flat screen Christmas Yule Log
burns bright in HD 

winter morning --
this egg and me
in the kitchen

persimmon tree
mallards drink in
its reflection

migratory pelicans...
the pollster presses
for an opinion

crescent moon
a young mockingbird
with its one song

fever dream
a bird chirps the refrain
from the latin mass

first frost
another wish
goes on their list

first frost
why did I never
plant evergreens?

harvest days--
a fat toad
leaves the garden

the coming rain-- 
bird calls echo 
along the creek

early spring
pallets of fertilizer
on the loading dock

dark days of winter
another mailbox loses
to the snowplow

steeping tea--
no more or less
of the thin snow

first snow--
a dusting of flour
in the cake pans

cinco de mayo--
I walk downhill to watch
the moon rise again

spring storm--
overripe bananas
in the kitchen

evening thunder--
robin calls echo
across the park

the barn doors open--
dry leaves sweep
into the muddy yard

no moon--
the individual
songs of crickets

passing monarchs --
a few leaves flutter
to the road

cicadas
at twilight
finally it rains

summer's end
an orange sunset
crayoned on the wall

dark days of winter
at my office window
I watch the sunrise

evening walk
same flickering glow
house to house

Museum of Transport
train, tracks and gravel
the morning sun warms up
the smell of creosote 

warm rain
smells of tar, dirt,
and snails

out of the cloud's shadow -
suddenly white

a load of snow
going south

cancer ward -
a yellow woman
applies lipstick

laundry encounter
a plastic shark
falls out of a bath towel

early march snowstorm
his kite hangs from the ceiling
gathers dust

'seven samurai' *
half the village burning
while my son makes popcorn

 bare trees
in patches of fog
from here
to the scarecrow

wild fires
in the mist
the ashes

grandfather's grave
just another stone
for the dragonfly

a sleepless hour
first the geese
then the train

fall clock
the deer by the pond
an hour earlier

morning troubles
it starts with a dead cricket
in the spider web

cotton fields*
the only white left
is the snow

it's as if winter
is about to leave
mom
with the slant in her back
and the sail in her hair

eclipse
the path of the sun
blocked by billboards

Presidents' weekend
all that dirty laundry
sorted by mothers

ring around the moon
I remember parts
of a nursery rhyme

empty bleachers
a late night fog
takes the field

butterfly on the windshield
another journey
incomplete

dead leaves and rust
a few things remain
in the fallout shelter

early summer
the ice cream truck
makes another round

carousel rider
the pole still warm
from her touch

old cottonfields
a long time
between snows

harmonica player
he cups the cold
in his hands

our anniversary
so many candle flames
in the mirror

new gravesite
the persistent taps
of a woodpecker

desert highway
in the rear view mirror
blue flashing lights

emergency broadcast
we head for the storm cellar
with a bottle of wine

late spring
each clock in the house
shows a different time

leaving home
the warmth still inside
my freshly ironed shirt

gray drizzle
for miles and miles
this road I'm on

liberty market
one free pickle
from the barrel

christmas album
every year he wears
the same flannel shirt

murmur of rain
hard to catch the words
when he talks in his sleep

what if
the flavor of burnt toast
is in the fallen seed
my desire for bitternut
despite its name*

moonless night
a spoonful of darkness
stirring my tea

bullfrog chorus
one a little louder
than the rest

lonesome train whistle. . . 
suddenly grandpa's mind
becomes sharp again 

failed copy
the real iris bluer
than the photograph

sad news
the blur of reading
through tears

summer haze
the thin gauze
of her white dress

pale legs
under a white moon~
shivering aspen

beach house
a bit of sand
in my tea

beautiful blue
the pattern in your eyes
before death drained their color
and left you in that vacant room
to dream of open skies

dark lamp shade--
squinting her eyes in low light
to read your letter

tuesday sunrise
spilling grains of sugar
in my black tea

bitter quarrel
the lingering taste
of too many aspirin

mother daughter
lunch
storm and thunder

giant moon.
all neighborhoods share
the same yard light

molten by a morning sun
frozen cranes take wing
one by one

not breathing
Japanese cranes
pausing in the snow

a hundred thousand spectators
three laureates
a moth

flooded paddies
floating rice shoots -
relentless rain

unmown grass
in the cemetery -
lighting bugs

the colour of wind
through pine trees
must be blue

saw grass--
bluebottles teeming
on a white skull

late afternoon--
the first cow
heads to the barn

porn shop-
the graying clerk reads
Hegel

cold snap-
her pause before
each tulip

young lake ice sings
a tune more ancient
than footprints

Coltrane
two floors up...floats
out a window

her hair
brushed with moonlight...
forty years ago

another test
another doctor visit
long winter nights

two moons
on August 27th
Mother's birthdate

silence
the moon breaks through
the firework smoke

tired new mom -
brown leaves
falling from the green trees

dans la forêt,
tout est nouveau à mes yeux

of daffodils

se penchent vers l'est

son image
sur la surface de l'eau

nuit grise
-- sur la vitre l'ombre
d'une étoile en paille

premier novembre
tout lentement un papillon
trouve sa tache de soleil

dernières feuilles rousses
un papillon prend l'envol
tout près de la terre

fin septembre
à travers la feuille rongée
le ciel bleu

une petite brise
les feuilles tombent
sur les pétales

quartier de l'aéroport
sous les traînées qui s'estompent
le vol du héron

nuit d'automne
dans la lumière bleue
une rose jaune

la rosée blanche
sur les trèfles --
la lune de jour

Spring rain-
after "Dear Ed"
the paper still blank

la vague de froid
les contours nets
de la demi-lune --

dernier jour de l'an
-- traces de luges rouillées
dans la neige d'hier

bruine de septembre
lente tombée d'une feuille
contre le tronc noir

soleil derrière le nuage
une petite citrouille chaude
dans ma paume

bruits feutrés
quelques secondes des ailes
du papillon

le Danube coule
dans la direction de l'aube
un blanc bateau

fraîche matinée
la boule du châtaignier
bien fermée

le creux et la crête
se cognent contre les rochers
le ciel après l'orage

un papillon volète
au-dessus des rochers

pas encore fleuri

for each cricket chirp

petits poils au-dessus de sa lèvre
un magazine de mode

l'aube de fin juin
un bourgeon du lys orange
s'appuyant sur le prunier mort


juillet:
deux petites dames
odeur de la lessive
lune de nacre

septembre:
les vaguelettes s'en vont vers le sud
deux baigneurs de soleil
se promènent

une île et une grosse vague
mal à l'aise en regardant le choix
de son fond d'écran

juin: un midi torride
les joncs dans les pots à fleurs
dans un moule à lac noir

old mill town
each company house
a carbon copy

mai:
les oiseaux s'envolent
le long de la façade
tombent les ombres

le vent en bourrasques
une étoile en paille oscille lentement
quand on parle

la route de travail
dans les feuilles et les galets
un sillon profond

ce soir dans la rue
un parfum du chocolat
noir

les dos noirs des pierres tombales
-- quelques couleurs à l'horizon
après le coucher de soleil

lilas roux
derrière la grille rouillée
le chant d'enfant

l'orage ce matin
un demi-cercle parfait
du rosier en fleurs

lumière du bureau
une courte ombre
autour de la pomme

premiers crocus fanés
de plus en plus varié
le chant des oiseaux

le dégel
dans une fenêtre étroite
la demi-lune


long winter night
after chapter six
the tea is cold

...vos haikus estivals
une note des poires et des myrtilles
dans le thé

la neige tombe
un peu inclinée
la lune

nuages chair de poisson
sur le pare-brise de l'ambulance

secousses du tramway
pointe de l' hameçon
au soleil

la lune blanche
un peu fondu
le givre sur les toits

ce matin
le rouge des tramways
première neige

une nouvelle voiture
la feuille se pose plus loin
-- bruine

5 heures du matin
derrière la buée du souffle
ceinture de l'Orion

 ils boitent tous
sur la pente de l’ancien quai
-- les oiseaux reprennent

une autre poussière
le lendemain de la pluie
traces des gouttes

first cold snap
all the quilts
still at the cleaners

jambes croisées
nous buvons nos cafés
et parlons de la guerre

dispute familiale
la fumée monte de la soupe
la neige tombe

silence
une mouche sèche s'éparpille
sur le linoleum

film sur Matisse
-- il coupe le papier bleu
et le reflet de mon frère

le train passe
des chardons et des camomilles
fleurissent entre les rails

poitrine nue
l`afficheur colle rapidement
le dernier morceau


symphonie de Beethoven
et l'emballage des génoises
qui se défroisse

l'herbe givrée
déjà la nuque du cheval
au soleil

rideau à moitié
meubles d'une chambre éclairée
-- traits gris de la demi-lune

orage d'avril
aux pieds des statues des reines de France
fleurs des marronniers

Christmas morning
grandpa explains that yo-yos
don't need batteries

odeur du bitume
et parfum d'un homme--
pommier en fleurs, en ville

croassement et craquement
des morceaux de givre tombent
dans le feu

sous le ciel bleu d`acier
manger une pomme vereuse
-- nuit de gel

neige couvre le givre--
jouant une pièce gaie au violon
mince lumiere sous ta porte

pleine lune d`octobre
sur les rails --
le vent chaud

un enfant scrute
le visage mutilé--
bruit de caisse

rain on the river– 
when does white become
its darkest colour --

Kirkstone Pass
a sheepdog gathers
its part of the world

mistfall
the swansongs
of orb spiders

dark news
the comfort
of crows

moonless night-
out on the island someone
lays on the horn

hard frost-
the snail-hammerings
of a song thrush

700,000 olive trees remember the butterfly

family home
the grain of the wood
enters his hands 

dark news
the comfort
of crows

sleep disorder
the gas station lights
keep me company

the half-truths
in a well-lit room
midnight's rain

first morning
the marks of a moth
in old laundry

a lamb's cry
scudding clouds over
the cemetery wall

train whistle
a blackbird hops
along its notes

the moon is broken
Battersea Power Station
from a train window

harvest moon--
in the heartland her laughter
still fills the kitchen

Valentine's Day
my wife reads up
on Henry VIII

zombie debt-
the practised slice
of a bread knife

lime quarter
an ice cube collapses
over jazz

lullaby of rain
another pinch of saffron
in the pumpkin soup

woodfire
flickering in the silence
corralled horses 

thunder snow
the wind-shifting scent
of fox

Gare du Nord
the slow change of snow
on fake fur

fighting illness-
the darkness before the light
of the new year

bag of beer
snail trails leave it
from all directions

sunday lunch
the chatter of children
among hard drinkers

ebb tide-
they suddenly have
cold feet

the night train passes
along the mountain trail
garlic snores

the rain
almost a friend
this funeral

October wind
sweeping cobwebs
from the wood pile

dusty knickknacks
mother's whole life
on one shelf

sunlit helmet
the young soldier's eyes
invisible

endless rain
without opening
a crocus falls

evening coffee—
wisps of fog rise
from the bayou

the lilac in bud—
a cloud with storm in it
swells over the bay 

partly cloudy—
I remember the face
but not the name

intertwined
in my washing machine,
my daughter's bras
and the jeans of
her latest boyfriend

false hope
a film of oil carries
bent rainbows downstream

whiskey moon—
a morning after
at the bottle’s end

a lake
brimming with mountains—
trout ripple the sky

mother-in-law's face
on the biggest pumpkin
harvest moon --

untwisting
the rose bud
spring rain

fireworks gone
Orion's beauty remains
in the stillness

solitary walk -
at nightfall the flash
of distant fireworks

stroke of midnight
the blast of foghorns
along the coast

after the rain
I check the growth
of each tulip

a lost dream
cellular phone
on the night train

Sunday morning
smells of French toast
and cinnamon...

drip.drip.drip.drip.drip.
the anticipation
of maple syrup

How thin the moon!
the scent of lilacs
grows fainter...

divorce hearing
we talk about
the rain

daybreak
the train graffiti drips
autumn dew

the slow drift...
sunbeam across
an empty room

in her eyes
the end our date
the moon

as she yells stillness of the ficus
comme elle hurle silence du ficus

in the lap
of a stone Buddha
fresh snow

divorce proceedings our bed gets bigger and bigger
procédure de divorce notre lit devient de plus en plus large

silently day becomes night in this childless house
silencieusement le jour devient la nuit dans cette maison sans enfants

picking up his toys
still in my funeral clothes
the very last time
